You would like to evaluate configuration changes daily to AWS resources based on these security policies. One organizational requirement is to ensure that VPC flow logs are enabled in all the VPCs in your AWS account.

You also can create custom Config rules based on criteria you define within an AWS Lambda function. AWS Config Rules enables you to implement security policies as code for your organization and evaluate configuration changes to AWS resources against these policies. You can use Config rules to audit your use of AWS resources for compliance with custom rules such as VPC flow logging. A CloudFormation template will only ensure new VPC deployments are compliant.

Recently the application has begun to perform slowly.  They notice that the eviction rate is high for the Cluster.  What could you consider doing to rectify this issue?","explanation":"Scaling up and out is the recommended approach when the eviction rate is high on the cluster.  Elasticache is an in-memory service and therefore cannot use Provisioned IOPs for storage.  AWS does not provide an auto scaling service in Elasticache. Increasing the ConnectionOverhead value would reduce the amount of memory available for storing cache items, so is unlikely to improve the eviction rate.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/mem-ug/CacheMetrics.WhichShouldIMonitor.html#metrics-evictions","title":"Which Metrics Should I Monitor?"}],"answers":[{"id":"ea661bc3f4ee7300ed230572ef878635","text":"Increase the cluster size or add more nodes to the cluster","correct":true},{"id":"0dedcafa7f1671fda48c2d4515da1fcb","text":"Enable Autoscaling on the Elasticache Cluster","correct":false},{"id":"c8e144f5e160266566a48649def7cb74","text":"Redeploy the Elasticache cluster to use Provisioned IOPs storage","correct":false},{"id":"85688e53214b00837ac8ae9bb22e9d81","text":"Increase the ConnectionOverhead value of the cluster","correct":false}]},{"id":"6ef01959-f96f-4529-91e6-fd45696273ef","domain":"networking","question":"You are a SysOps Administrator setting up secure access for IAM users in your organization to an S3 bucket.

How would you implement a cost-effective solution?","explanation":"A gateway endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined to a supported AWS service. S3 and DyanamoDB are the only two AWS services supported by gateway endpoints. A gateway endpoint would allow you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.

To use latency-based routing, you create latency records for your resources in multiple AWS Regions.

When you create an IAM role using the IAM console, the console creates an instance profile automatically and gives it the same name as the role to which it corresponds.

What would you do to remedy the situation?","explanation":"Note that when using Amazon Glacier as a storage class in Amazon S3 you use the Amazon S3 API, and when using “native” Amazon Glacier you use the Amazon Glacier API. For example, objects archived to Amazon Glacier using Amazon S3 lifecycle policies can only be listed and retrieved by using the Amazon S3 API or the Amazon S3 console. You can’t see them as archives in an Amazon Glacier vault. You cannot unlock a vault once the Vault Lock has been activated after the 24 hour validation period.

If you've attached one or more load balancers or target groups to your Auto Scaling group, the group does not, by default, consider an instance unhealthy and replace it if it fails the load balancer health checks.

AWS Auto Scaling makes scaling simple with recommendations that allow you to optimize performance, costs, or balance between them. With auto scaling you can scale-out Amazon EC2 instances seamlessly and automatically when demand increases, shed unneeded Amazon EC2 instances automatically and save money when demand subsides, and scale dynamically based on your Amazon CloudWatch metrics, or predictably according to a schedule that you define. Purchasing reserved instances, although cheaper than on-demand, would not necessarily cut costs. Since demand is unpredictable you may be purchasing a commitment that you may not use. There is no indication that the application will be running for at least a year. This is true even after right-sizing.
