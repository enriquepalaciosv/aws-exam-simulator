Every time a customer completes a purchase, streaming data is immediately sent back to your endpoint and is placed onto a Kinesis Data Stream.  Most of the year, traffic remains static and no scaling of the Stream is necessary.  However, during the Black Friday period, scaling is required and this is accomplished by increasing the KCL instances and also re-sharding the Kinesis Stream.  This year, when sharding some of the streams, it was noticed that an extra shard was left after the operation finished, and this meant that if an even number of shards was requested, the number of open shards became odd.  You have been asked to troubleshoot the issue and find the cause and resolution from the list below.","explanation":"This is an issue which occurs from time to time when re-sharding.  The difference between the StartingHashKey and EndingHashKey values is normally large (depending on the number of shards you have in the stream).  Occasionally, the difference can be a very low value such as 1 and this causes the UpdateShardCount to end up with an extra shard.  This can usually be resolved by finding the ShardID with next adjacent Hash Key value, and merging the small shard with the larger shard.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction.html","title":"What Is Amazon Kinesis Data Streams?"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/troubleshooting-consumers.html","title":"Troubleshooting Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Consumers"}],"answers":[{"id":"c5d9d335c1cea4d9ab165da89fc4240f","text":"This occurs when an unhandled exception is thrown in the KCL from the processRecords code, and a record is skipped.
