It is arbitrary whether the connection itself is public or private. What AWS solution would you recommend to the customer?","explanation":"Using AWS Direct Connect, data that would have previously been transported over the Internet can now be delivered through a private network connection between AWS and your data center or corporate network. In many circumstances, private network connections can reduce costs, increase bandwidth, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections. The requirement is to have a consistent network connection, and the transfer can happen in a few months. If you need an immediate connection, then use a VPN as it can be set up within a few hours or less. However a VPN does not provide a consistent network experience as it depends on an Internet connection.
