Each new product event requires that iterative code changes be made during pre-launch preparation based on marketing department feedback and testing results. Slow response times for users have occurred during previous launches, so leadership has directed that load tests be conducted on the e-commerce platform after each new code release. Load testing requires significant time to manually setup and execute, which slows down the development process. You've been tasked with creating an automated load testing service on AWS to shorten testing windows. Which architecture will you recommend to provide scalable load testing capabilities?","explanation":"Simulating thousands of connected users generating a select number of transactions per second can be done without having to provision servers. A test automation framework Docker image deployed on AWS Fargate can be scaled according to user-specified test scenarios. The test scenarios can be created in a web application, and written to S3 and DynamoDB by a Lambda function front-ended by API Gateway. These test scenarios can then be read by another Lambda function to manage Fargate's container scaling to generate the desired load on the e-commerce application. Hosting the web application on Elastic Beanstalk is overkill since test scenarios will probably be entered by a single user for only a short duration of time. S3 configured for static web hosting is a more economical option. Auto Scaling EC2 instances won't generate load according to the specified test scenarios - there's no way to get those scenarios into scaling policies. Running the test automation framework in a Lambda function will risk exceeding Lambda's maximum execution time.

With this constraint dealt with, we can eliminate all options that don't include the ECS Cluster.  Putting all containers on one ECS Cluster would work technically, but wouldn't be cost effective and would mean an internal departmental application lives on the same cluster as the main core production applications.

What is the quickest way to reduce the latency for these customers?","explanation":"As we are not told otherwise, we can assume that the European site is fast for people within Europe and therefore we can assume a high latency is the cause of the problem.  Route 53 Latency-Based Routing sounds like the perfect candidate when utilising the Disaster Recovery site as the main site for Asia Pacific.  CloudFront could offer some help if we only had one site and the Edge locations could cache some content, but in this case the CTO wanted to use the Disaster Recovery infrastructure already in place.","links":[{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/route53/faqs/","title":"Amazon Route 53 FAQs"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Tutorials.html","title":"Tutorials"}],"answers":[{"id":"6752c886fe176d4a7c3fd5d847abf946","text":"In Route 53, create two records for www.mega-widgets.com, a latency record pointing to the European IP and a latency record pointing to the Asia Pacific IP.","correct":true},{"id":"883bf6152c030fbe021fafb5fb55c8d4","text":"In Route 53, create two sub-domain A records of mega-widgets.com, one with the European IP and the other with the Asia Pacific IP.

Every application has been analysed to see whether it is best hosted on an EC2 instance or as a Lambda function. One particular software project has been rewritten to store an object in an S3 bucket, and then this action triggers a Lambda function to compress the file as a new object in the same bucket, and then delete the original. Unfortunately, due to the way you have deployed the solution the Lambda function appears to be constantly invoking itself and is stuck in a continuous loop.  How do you temporarily stop this from happening whilst you investigate?","explanation":"When architecting a solution, always ensure that you do not generate a recursive loop.  This is when something in one part of the infrastructure will trigger something elsewhere, and in turn trigger the first part once again.  In particular these scenarios are problematic when one AWS service triggers another AWS service and this in turn triggers the first.  In the example, this can only be rectified by enabling the Throttle option, which sets the reserved concurrency to zero and will throttle all future invocations of this function. This action should only be used in case of emergencies.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-troubleshooting.html","title":"Troubleshooting AWS Lambda"}],"answers":[{"id":"bdaac855074eb8ac866a362c5e7d6713","text":"Remove the IAM User or Role associated with the Lambda function to cease operation.

Your Manager has said that RDS is now showing a RDS-EVENT-0045 error after one of the team made a configuration change, then left to go on holiday.  After restarting the replication, you briefly get an RDS-EVENT-0046 notification which quickly returns another RDS-EVENT-0045 notification and replication stops again.

It can't be a database engine issue, because replication will only run on a transactional engine like InnoDB.
