This security group is configured to only allow inbound traffic from 192.168.0.0/24. A collegue has also configured a NACL on the subnet that the instance resides on, and this NACL is configured to block all traffic, except where the source or destination is in 192.168.0.0/24. What will happen when an instance with an IP of 192.168.1.12 tries to connect to your instance on port 80?","explanation":"With inbound traffic, NACLs are evaluated before Security Groups. As the NACL is configured to only allow traffic from 192.168.0.0/24 and the IP 192.168.1.12 does not fall within that range, it will be blocked by the NACL before reaching the Security Groups.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Security.html","title":"VPC Security"}],"answers":[{"id":"eb5d4be456a62dd4f884a4b47c45fd46","text":"The traffic will be blocked simultaneously by the Security Group and NACL","correct":false},{"id":"5298f0866dac220c6bbad6d2da2163d8","text":"The traffic will be allowed as it is still within a private range","correct":false},{"id":"d3d7c67e2cf8c1d1cb89971fd90c2b72","text":"The security group will block the traffic before it is evaluated by the NACL","correct":false},{"id":"c885215eb76a3baac02ca8ea6da9a7b4","text":"The NACL will block the traffic before it is evaluated by the security group","correct":true}]},{"id":"da330db7-b053-45f5-99ab-ba3fa6fefb22","domain":"ResilientDesign","question":"You have a customer hosting their website on a cluster of web servers behind a internet facing load balancer.

A secondary database needs to be available as quickly as possible. Which would provide that capability best?","explanation":"When you provision a Multi-AZ RDB Instance, AWS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physical infrastructure. In case of an infrastructure failure, AWS performs an automatic failover to the standby instance, so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete.

The organization has three accounts called production, development, and testing. As per company policy, all accounts use identical Linux EC2 instances that are in the same region and configured with default tenancy. The production account has seven Reserved regional EC2 instances to support its production environment. Last month, the testing account used two On-Demand EC2 instances running 24/7, while the development account used three On-Demand EC2 instances running 24/7. Because of a decrease in usage last month, the production account used only five of its reserved EC2 instances. How is the organization billed for EC2 instance usage last month?","explanation":"Unused Reserved EC2 instances can offset the cost of equivalent On-Demand EC2 instances. The higher cost of two On-Demand instances is replaced by the lower cost of two unused Reserved instances.

You remember that you have a Basic Support plan. Which of the following case types can you open with this support plan?","explanation":"There are three types of AWS Support cases you can open; they are Account and Billing Support, Service Limit Increase, and Technical Support. Customer Service does not exist as a case type, which eliminates 'Customer Service'. With the Basic plan, you can open either an Account and Billing Support or a Service Limit Increase case. To open a Technical Support case, you will need to get a Developer, Business, or Enterprise plan. So, 'Technical Support' is the wrong response; 'Account and Billing Support' and 'Service Limit Increase' are correct.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/getting-started.html","title":"Features of AWS Support Plans"}],"answers":[{"id":"fec5f90e9985e1f7b8cc6752739ce9b1","text":"Technical Support","correct":false},{"id":"d5552e0564007d93ff5937a9cb3bc491","text":"Customer Service","correct":false},{"id":"88d14dddd26c18290989cf3ac6ef6141","text":"Account and Billing Support","correct":true},{"id":"d073dd2e04eae29e3dd076f213f01fe3","text":"Service Limit Increase","correct":true}]},{"id":"53543ab6-d7b3-4a4f-a3ba-fde0ca70ed9b","domain":"Performant","question":"Six years ago you launched a new app and had the forethought to design the environment to use ELBs and simple robust autoscaling groups.  This has served well however recently you are seeing that the demand is coming on very steeply as people check the services 1st thing in the morning.  Your dashboard is now showing that customer connections are being delayed and at time rejected.  This is impacting your previously five-star customer satisfaction rating.  Why is your design failing?","explanation":"Auto scaling is not really intended to respond to instantaneous spikes in traffic.  Even in the Cloud commissioning a server takes real time.  The bigger and more complicated the server the longer it takes.  There are ways to deal with this from redesign to use more agile compute like containers and Serverless, step and overlapping autoscaling policies to more rapidly respond, or scheduled scaling for predictable loads. AMIs may be 'legacy', but there is no limit as implied in the answer.  Scaling policies can block each other, but it would not result in a 'per hour' limitation.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scale-based-on-demand.html","title":"Dynamic Scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-cloudwatch-metrics.html","title":"CloudWatch Metrics for Your Application Load Balancer"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-cloudwatch-metrics.html","title":"CloudWatch Metrics for Your Classic Load Balancer"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/Cooldown.html","title":"autoScaling cooldown"}],"answers":[{"id":"612acf301ab3c0f2bca86d2056ddaa0d","text":"Using multiple autoscaling groups can confuse the scaling algorithm causing delays in initiating new instances.","correct":false},{"id":"5c7b8ce4a67af83307447d9fe679a66c","text":"Simple autoscaling is better suited for slow uptake than rapid or steep uptake in demand.","correct":true},{"id":"27a7809b77e13496ba126da27107c680","text":"Your down scaling policy is wrong resulting in a limit to how many new instances can be launched per hour.","correct":false},{"id":"62cb96bc5208881af5c2e6ae7304b484","text":"The launch configuration is using legacy AMIs which are in short supply resulting in a delay in scaling response.","correct":false}]},{"id":"bdfff765-ad59-45a9-9e3c-605a3d2ad9d7","domain":"ResilientDesign","question":"You have been asked to set up an EFS storage solution for a project team.
