Compared to traditional infrastructure approaches, it is also often significantly less expensive to develop, deliver, and operate a web or mobile backend when it has been architected in a serverless fashion. The question allows architectural restructuring and serverless would be the best approach.

One of the easiest options is to provide more I/O throughput than you can provision for a single EBS volume.  This can be done by striping using RAID 0.  You can join multiple gp2, io1, st1, or sc1 volumes together in a RAID 0 configuration to provide parallel read/write performance. The second option is to choose an EC2 instance type that supports EBS optimization.  This ensures that network traffic will not contend with traffic between your instance and your EBS volumes.  The final correct choice is only related to HDD based EBS volumes.  When you create a snapshot of a Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) or Cold HDD (sc1) volume, performance may drop as far as the volume's baseline value while the snapshot is in progress. This behaviour is specific to these volume types.  Therefore you should ensure that scheduled snapshots are carried at times of low usage.  The one option on the list which is entirely incorrect is the one that states \"Never use HDD volumes, always ensure that SSDs are used\" as the question first states \"In addition to choosing the correct EBS volume type for your specific task\".  HDDs may well be suitable to certain tasks and therefore they should not be discounted because they may not have have the highest specification on paper.","links":[{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/features/","title":"Amazon EBS features"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSPerformance.html","title":"Amazon EBS Volume Performance on Linux Instances"}],"answers":[{"id":"060ad726277222bf1fdf1470ea833f1a","text":"Stripe volumes together in a RAID 0 configuration.","correct":true},{"id":"5f33f064dbad9a3f30cd0395c1ae2106","text":"Ensure that your EC2 instances are types that can be optimized for use with EBS","correct":true},{"id":"154b9cbae5d3f37e232f1a00c5364547","text":"Schedule snapshots of HDD based volumes for periods of low use","correct":true},{"id":"2b3853ec27d2a5f7a8fb114b5fcfc321","text":"Never use HDD volumes, always ensure that SSDs are used","correct":false}]},{"id":"025f7c87-6ee6-4dd9-8377-9a25598286ca","domain":"deployment","question":"Which of the following statements about a standard SQS queue is true:","explanation":"With standard queues, SQS will deliver each message at least once, but cannot guarantee the delivery order.

This load balancer always sits in front of your application running on EC2 as it has the important function of forwarding HTTPS requests on port 443 to HTTP requests on port 80 on the instance. As demand for the application grows you need to reuse this load balancer configuration in multiple other deployments of the application and you need to use CloudFormation to do this in an automated way. What is the most efficient way to deploy the load balancer configuration?","explanation":"Nested stacks are stacks created as part of other stacks. You create a nested stack within another stack by using the AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource. For example, assume that you have a load balancer configuration that you use for most of your stacks. Instead of copying and pasting the same configurations into your templates, you can create a dedicated template for the load balancer. Then, you just use the resource to reference that template from within other templates. Lambda would not be able to deploy infrastructure resources as efficiently as CloudFormation nested stacks. AWS CloudFormation provides two methods for updating stacks: direct update or creating and executing change sets. When you directly update a stack, you submit changes and AWS CloudFormation immediately deploys them. Use direct updates when you want to quickly deploy your updates. With change sets, you can preview the changes AWS CloudFormation will make to your stack, and then decide whether to apply those changes.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html","title":"Working with Nested Stacks"}],"answers":[{"id":"67c3f9750fe6b5768341534dcf97ba93","text":"Use AWS CloudFormation nested stacks by creating a dedicated template for the load balancer and refer to that template within other templates.","correct":true},{"id":"97cc8d8d6d33e845e203f2c7d07e776e","text":"Use AWS CloudFormation direct updates to quickly deploy the same load balancer configuration in multiple environments.","correct":false},{"id":"d8c538a0c914101c9d913c3644dfeecd","text":"Use AWS CloudFormation change sets to change the load balancer configuration based on Region/AZ where you want to deploy a copy of the application.","correct":false},{"id":"54ac82e3cb0e853af8ce69674edafd64","text":"Instead of CloudFormation, use Lambda.
