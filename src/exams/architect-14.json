Which architecture will provide the best performance efficiency for the chat platform?","explanation":"CloudFront supports WebSockets to establish persistent connections, which provide lower latency for real-time communications. Origin behaviors specify which origin satisfies which type of content request (ex. all .jpg files), not which origin servers to use. Route 53 is not needed, because requests for CloudFront content are automatically routed to the edge location with the lowest latency.

An EC2 instance reads multiple Amazon Kinesis streams of scores and stats and writes them to the database. Two app users sitting side-by-side at a restaurant refresh the scoreboard at the same time and get different stats for the same game. What should the app developers do to resolve this?","explanation":"DynamoDB is eventually consistent by default, and may not reflect the results of a recently completed write since data is automatically replicated across three facilities in an AWS region for durability. You can request strongly consistent reads that reflect all previous writes. Consolidating Kinesis streams probably won't help since Kineses producers are generally singular data sources (all stats of a specific type will come from one producer). Replacing Lambda with EC2 will have cost consequences, and in this case will probably result in an undesirable stateful architecture.

In addition, this solution must provide you with an audit trail that shows you when and who used the CMK. Which of the following choices denote this type of encryption?","explanation":"Generally speaking, SSE is actually correct. However, the question is asking for a specific type of server-side encryption. SSE-S3 is another possible answer, since it encrypts the objects in the S3 buckets and Amazon S3 manages the encryption keys. However, the CMK and audit trail attributes are missing from this choice. With SSE-KMS, you get the CMK addition for added protection, as well as the audit trail, which is why SSE-KMS is the right answer.
