When checking the file contents, the developer does not see the updated file contents. What is the cause of this issue?","explanation":"Amazon S3 offers eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES in all Regions. Amazon S3 provides high availability and high durability by replicating bucket objects across multiple availability zones and servers. This means that any updates to objects must replicate across all servers storing the data. This can take some time.

The Auto Scaling group runs behind an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). When you check the ELB logs, you notice that a number of instances are failing the health check during periods of high demand. New instances are launching but they periodically fail health checks and subsequent instances are being launched which is increasing costs. What would you do to troubleshoot this issue?","explanation":"Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits until the health check grace period ends before checking the health status of the instance. Amazon EC2 status checks and Elastic Load Balancing health checks can complete before the health check grace period expires. However, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not act on them until the health check grace period expires. To provide ample warm-up time for your instances, ensure that the health check grace period covers the expected startup time for your application. In this scenario, the health checks are most likely occurring before the EC2 instance and its applications have fully loaded, so increasing the health check grace period would likely resolve the issue. The cooldown period helps to ensure that your Auto Scaling group doesn't launch or terminate additional instances before the previous scaling activity takes effect, and are not used for health checks. Creating a new ELB or Auto Scaling group would have no impact but the problem would persist.

Investigation reveals that top news stories are impacting the database performance. Top news stories must be updated every 15 minutes.  What would be an optimal and non-intrusive solution for this problem?","explanation":"The optimal solution is to create a CloudFront distribution and configure the TTL to 900 seconds. CloudFront can cache the top news stories. It is a highly available and highly scalable service ensuring that any sudden increase in web traffic can be accommodated. Setting the TTL to 900 seconds ensures that the news stories are refreshed in the CloudFront distribution according to the specified requirements. Implementing ElastiCashe is not an optimal solution as it would require application re-engineering to take advantage of the service. Upgrading the database instance may be a temporary solution. However, this is not a long term scalable solution if the website traffic continues to increase. Creating read-replicas of the database is not an ideal solution. The question does not specify if the database supports read-replicas. Even if that were the case, implementing read-replicas as a solution would require other components, such as load balancers to distribute the traffic. It would also require application re-engineering for routing database write operations to the main database.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html","title":"What Is Amazon CloudFront?"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html","title":"Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration)"}],"answers":[{"id":"f2f9434e6b8f0c06ea7779737fcf5b83","text":"Create a CloudFront distribution.

To reduce load on their upstream systems, the ABC corp have enabled API Gateway caching. A small number of developer customers still need access to results directly from the integration endpoint. To prevent all developer customers from bypassing the cache, ABC corp has also enabled the requirement for cache invalidation to require authorization.\n\nWhat must a developer customer do to return a result that is not cached from the API Gateway?","explanation":"Setting a Cache-Control: max-age=0 HTTP header as part of the request tells API Gateway that you want a response directly from the integration endpoint, rather than a cached response. This header can be interpreted as the client stating the maximum age a cached result can be is 0 seconds - equivalent to saying it cannot be cached at all.\n\nAs the cache is configured to require authorization to be invalidated, the request must be signed with a user or role that allows the execute-api:InvalidateCache action to be performed on the API Gateway resource. An example of this policy is found in the documentation for API Gateway Caching. We have also included a link to how to sign a request using AWS Signature Version 4.\n\nIt is recommended that you require authorization to invalidate a cached response; otherwise, if a significant number of requests perform an invalidation, the cache is no longer helping reduce load on upstream systems.\n\nCalling flush-stage-cache is incorrect because this would delete all data in the entire API cache, rather than just for the response the client has requested.

The reads are then forwarded to Lambda downstream for processing critical customer information including purchasing and inventory data. It is critical that this data is not lost. How would you accommodate failed Lambda captures of the data?","explanation":"A dead letter queue would allow you to prevent data loss. After a message is taken from the queue and returned for the maximum number of retries, it is automatically sent to a dead letter queue, if one has been configured. It stays there until you retrieve it for forensic purposes. To prevent other consumers from processing the message again, Amazon SQS sets a visibility timeout, a period of time during which Amazon SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing the message. The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. DelaySeconds for individual messages are similar to visibility timeouts because both features make messages unavailable to consumers for a specific period of time. The difference between the two is that, for delay queues, a message is hidden when it is first added to queue, whereas for visibility timeouts a message is hidden only after it is consumed from the queue. A FIFO queue guarantees first-in-first-out.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html","title":"Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues"}],"answers":[{"id":"5d63d8895abd795fa4b98f12304185dc","text":"Create a dead letter queue and set the Maximum Receives to 3.","correct":true},{"id":"b431614eebc36d55520274500ed9ba2d","text":"Create a FIFO queue and set DelaySeconds to 3.","correct":false},{"id":"7e66715cc7d52627f1372ab97dbd2350","text":"Requeue the message with DelaySeconds to 3.","correct":false},{"id":"029cff5be66415e342452d104b4e2e57","text":"Requeue the message with a VisibilityTimeout of 30 seconds.","correct":false}]},{"id":"0471ebc4-d106-4e3d-a3d4-0f594589ad5f","domain":"deployment","question":"How long can a message be retained in an SQS Queue?","explanation":"Messages will be retained in queues for up to 14 days.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-how-it-works.html#sqs-basic-requirements","title":"SQS - Basic Prerequisites"}],"answers":[{"id":"0e92d2ae86e7d3e8eece27b399af6ea3","text":"14 days","correct":true},{"id":"cb8f14fd3a41cfe1236a3c6b90077ca0","text":"7 days","correct":false},{"id":"947d8520f04473da621f2718138f3bc6","text":"30 days","correct":false},{"id":"e3b481d5297f475abc283227bedbd9b9","text":"1 day","correct":false}]},{"id":"9abb4110-4b7b-11ea-b77f-2e728ce88125","domain":"development","question":"You want to add a cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration to one of your S3 buckets.

There are two ARNs associated with this initial version, the qualified ARN which is the function ARN plus a version suffix e.g. $LATEST.

The function version for an unqualified function always maps to $LATEST, so you can access the latest version using either the qualified ARN with $LATEST, or the unqualified function ARN.
