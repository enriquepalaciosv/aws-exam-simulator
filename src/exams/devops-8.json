You currently use Elastic Beanstalk so you are restricted to what that service offers. Your manager thinks it would be best to only deploy to a few machines at a time, so if there are any failures only the few that have been updated will be affected, making a rollback easier. To start with, your manager would like the roll-outs to occur on 2 machines at a time but would like the option to increase that to 3 at a time in the future. Deployments are done during quiet periods for your application, so reduced capacity is not an issue.  Which deployment type do you implement, and how can you get the most reliable indication that deployments have not introduced errors to the servers?","explanation":"The rolling deployment policy is suitable.

You have been asked to deploy each container on the most suitable, cost effective and reliable AWS platform from the options below.","explanation":"In order to make the decision which options are the best, we should start with the deployment that has the most constraints and that is the application using Websockets as these require many network connections and should be installed as multiple tasks across the ECS Cluster.  With this constraint dealt with, we can eliminate all options that don't include the ECS Cluster.  Putting all containers on one ECS Cluster would work technically, but wouldn't be cost effective and would mean an internal departmental application lives on the same cluster as the main core production applications.

Each new product event requires that iterative code changes be made during pre-launch preparation based on marketing department feedback and testing results. Slow response times for users have occurred during previous launches, so leadership has directed that load tests be conducted on the e-commerce platform after each new code release. Load testing requires significant time to manually setup and execute, which slows down the development process. You've been tasked with creating an automated load testing service on AWS to shorten testing windows. Which architecture will you recommend to provide scalable load testing capabilities?","explanation":"Simulating thousands of connected users generating a select number of transactions per second can be done without having to provision servers. A test automation framework Docker image deployed on AWS Fargate can be scaled according to user-specified test scenarios. The test scenarios can be created in a web application, and written to S3 and DynamoDB by a Lambda function front-ended by API Gateway. These test scenarios can then be read by another Lambda function to manage Fargate's container scaling to generate the desired load on the e-commerce application. Hosting the web application on Elastic Beanstalk is overkill since test scenarios will probably be entered by a single user for only a short duration of time. S3 configured for static web hosting is a more economical option. Auto Scaling EC2 instances won't generate load according to the specified test scenarios - there's no way to get those scenarios into scaling policies.

You have workloads running on Amazon EC2 in ten different AWS accounts and in three AWS regions. Resolving the audit deficiency requires the creation of a centralized log monitoring capability for the AWS-based applications and infrastructure, and for certain on-premises systems that they interface with. You've been tasked with creating an automated solution that will satisfy the auditors. Which architecture will you implement for the solution?","explanation":"Amazon Elasticsearch is a fully managed service that lets you collect and analyze logs and metrics, giving you a comprehensive view into your applications and infrastructure, reducing mean time to detect (MTTD) and resolve (MTTR) issues. Amazon CloudWatch collects API events from CloudTrail, networking events from VPC Flow Logs, and application and system logs from EC2 instances via the CloudWatch Logs agent. Using a single CloudWatch log group ensures that system logs share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings. Lambda functions in each account can move log data from CloudWatch into Elasticsearch for indexing and visualization with Kibana. CloudWatch log streams are sequences of events from the same source, whereas a log group is a collection of log streams. Logstash works well for collecting logs, but is usually paired with Elasticsearch for log monitoring and analysis.

Every time a customer completes a purchase, streaming data is immediately sent back to your endpoint and is placed onto a Kinesis Data Stream.  Most of the year, traffic remains static and no scaling of the Stream is necessary.  However, during the Black Friday period, scaling is required and this is accomplished by increasing the KCL instances and also re-sharding the Kinesis Stream.  This year, when sharding some of the streams, it was noticed that an extra shard was left after the operation finished, and this meant that if an even number of shards was requested, the number of open shards became odd.  You have been asked to troubleshoot the issue and find the cause and resolution from the list below.","explanation":"This is an issue which occurs from time to time when re-sharding.  The difference between the StartingHashKey and EndingHashKey values is normally large (depending on the number of shards you have in the stream).
