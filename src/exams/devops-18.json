Most of the year, traffic remains static and no scaling of the Stream is necessary.  However, during the Black Friday period, scaling is required and this is accomplished by increasing the KCL instances and also re-sharding the Kinesis Stream.  This year, when sharding some of the streams, it was noticed that an extra shard was left after the operation finished, and this meant that if an even number of shards was requested, the number of open shards became odd.

With this constraint dealt with, we can eliminate all options that don't include the ECS Cluster.  Putting all containers on one ECS Cluster would work technically, but wouldn't be cost effective and would mean an internal departmental application lives on the same cluster as the main core production applications.  When we also exclude installing Docker directly on EC2 as there is no redundancy, this leaves the only option as using ECS for the core application, Fargate for the Website and Elastic Beanstalk for the internal application.","links":[{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/faqs/","title":"Amazon Elastic Container Service FAQs"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/faqs/","title":"AWS Elastic Beanstalk FAQs"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/faqs/","title":"AWS Fargate FAQs"}],"answers":[{"id":"d8af6733a20ec3d6677a1e9d0016f47a","text":"Deploy the Websocket application and the corporate Website on a managed ECS Cluster and deploy the departmental application in Fargate.","correct":false},{"id":"37d838ae967ac13002610a1398c9ffd2","text":"Deploy all of the Docker containers in Fargate.","correct":false},{"id":"cc5e3933e49bdce4224537871a4f765b","text":"Deploy all three applications on a managed ECS Cluster.","correct":false},{"id":"a09251d393d8cef1692aee1706d87dec","text":"Deploy the Websocket application on a managed ECS Cluster, the Corporate Website on Fargate and the Departmental application on Elastic Beanstalk.","correct":true},{"id":"31d397d0bdcff1d57aeca0011626b830","text":"Deploy the Websocket application on a managed ECS Cluster, the corporate Website in Fargate and install Docker on a single EC2 instance to run the departmental application.","correct":false}]},{"id":"85ec1f79-e327-44c4-a934-46e826ec0dd3","domain":"HAFTDR","question":"You currently run an autoscaled application which is database read heavy.
