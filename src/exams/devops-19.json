Assist your team by choosing the best ways to troubleshoot these problems.","explanation":"Most of these answers are valid troubleshooting solutions for various CloudFormation issues, but there is only one answer for the problems listed in the question. 'Invalid Value or Unsupported Resource Property' errors appear only if there is a parameter naming mistake or that the property names are unsupported. 'Resource Failed to Stabilize' errors appear because a timeout is exceeded, the AWS service isn't available or is interrupted.  Finally, any update which fails to rollback could be because of a number of reasons, but the most popular is due to the deployment account having permissions to create stacks, but not to modify or delete stacks.

Each new product event requires that iterative code changes be made during pre-launch preparation based on marketing department feedback and testing results. Slow response times for users have occurred during previous launches, so leadership has directed that load tests be conducted on the e-commerce platform after each new code release. Load testing requires significant time to manually setup and execute, which slows down the development process. You've been tasked with creating an automated load testing service on AWS to shorten testing windows. Which architecture will you recommend to provide scalable load testing capabilities?","explanation":"Simulating thousands of connected users generating a select number of transactions per second can be done without having to provision servers. A test automation framework Docker image deployed on AWS Fargate can be scaled according to user-specified test scenarios. The test scenarios can be created in a web application, and written to S3 and DynamoDB by a Lambda function front-ended by API Gateway. These test scenarios can then be read by another Lambda function to manage Fargate's container scaling to generate the desired load on the e-commerce application. Hosting the web application on Elastic Beanstalk is overkill since test scenarios will probably be entered by a single user for only a short duration of time. S3 configured for static web hosting is a more economical option. Auto Scaling EC2 instances won't generate load according to the specified test scenarios - there's no way to get those scenarios into scaling policies. Running the test automation framework in a Lambda function will risk exceeding Lambda's maximum execution time.

You have workloads running on Amazon EC2 in ten different AWS accounts and in three AWS regions. Resolving the audit deficiency requires the creation of a centralized log monitoring capability for the AWS-based applications and infrastructure, and for certain on-premises systems that they interface with. You've been tasked with creating an automated solution that will satisfy the auditors. Which architecture will you implement for the solution?","explanation":"Amazon Elasticsearch is a fully managed service that lets you collect and analyze logs and metrics, giving you a comprehensive view into your applications and infrastructure, reducing mean time to detect (MTTD) and resolve (MTTR) issues. Amazon CloudWatch collects API events from CloudTrail, networking events from VPC Flow Logs, and application and system logs from EC2 instances via the CloudWatch Logs agent. Using a single CloudWatch log group ensures that system logs share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings. Lambda functions in each account can move log data from CloudWatch into Elasticsearch for indexing and visualization with Kibana. CloudWatch log streams are sequences of events from the same source, whereas a log group is a collection of log streams. Logstash works well for collecting logs, but is usually paired with Elasticsearch for log monitoring and analysis. AWS Systems Manager agents send status and execution information back to Systems Manager, but not the application logs, which the CloudWatch Logs agents are capable of sending.","links":[{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/","title":"Amazon CloudWatch"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/","title":"Amazon Elasticsearch Service"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/centralized-logging/","title":"Centralized Logging"}],"answers":[{"id":"bc1e38ce114c629b8597b80ee4242dc1","text":"Implement CloudWatch Logs agents on all EC2 instances and set up a single log stream.

Every time a customer completes a purchase, streaming data is immediately sent back to your endpoint and is placed onto a Kinesis Data Stream.  Most of the year, traffic remains static and no scaling of the Stream is necessary.  However, during the Black Friday period, scaling is required and this is accomplished by increasing the KCL instances and also re-sharding the Kinesis Stream.  This year, when sharding some of the streams, it was noticed that an extra shard was left after the operation finished, and this meant that if an even number of shards was requested, the number of open shards became odd.  You have been asked to troubleshoot the issue and find the cause and resolution from the list below.","explanation":"This is an issue which occurs from time to time when re-sharding.  The difference between the StartingHashKey and EndingHashKey values is normally large (depending on the number of shards you have in the stream).  Occasionally, the difference can be a very low value such as 1 and this causes the UpdateShardCount to end up with an extra shard.  This can usually be resolved by finding the ShardID with next adjacent Hash Key value, and merging the small shard with the larger shard.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction.html","title":"What Is Amazon Kinesis Data Streams?"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/troubleshooting-consumers.html","title":"Troubleshooting Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Consumers"}],"answers":[{"id":"0e5554f90414fbfc45af06379bc77584","text":"This occurs if a shard iterator expires immediately before you can use it.
