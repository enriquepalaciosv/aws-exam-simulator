What AWS service can the team use to meet these requirements?","explanation":"AWS Secrets Manager is an AWS service that can be used to securely store, retrieve, and automatically rotate database credentials. AWS Secrets Manager has built-in integration for RDS databases. Applications use Secrets Manager API's to retrieve database credentials, enabling secure storage of sensitive information outside of the application code. Systems Manager Parameter Store provides secure storage of sensitive information. However, it does not provide automatic credentials rotation capability specified as a requirement in the question scenario. Key Management Service (KMS) is used for management of cryptographic encryption keys, not for storage of sensitive information.

Your company has been trending this quarter because a high profile movie star has recently signed a contract to endorse your products. As a result, the amount of data flowing through Kinesis has increased, causing you to increase the number of shards in your stream from 4 to 6. The application consuming the data runs on a single EC2 instance in us-east-1a with a second instance in us-east-1b which is used as a cold standby in case the primary instance fails. How many consumer instances will you now need in total to cope with the increased number of shards?","explanation":"Re-sharding enables you to increase or decrease the number of shards in a stream in order to adapt to changes in the rate of data flowing through the stream. You should ensure that the number of instances does not exceed the number of shards (except for failure standby purposes). Each shard is processed by exactly one KCL worker and has exactly one corresponding record processor, so you never need multiple instances to process one shard. However, one worker can process any number of shards, so it's fine if the number of shards exceeds the number of instances. When re-sharding increases the number of shards in the stream, the corresponding increase in the number of record processors increases the load on the EC2 instances that are hosting them. If the instances are part of an Auto Scaling group, and the load increases sufficiently, the Auto Scaling group adds more instances to handle the increased load.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/key-concepts.html","title":"Kinesis Data Streams Terminology"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/kinesis-record-processor-scaling.html","title":"Resharding, Scaling, and Parallel Processing"}],"answers":[{"id":"834a08c5c4b013c0a9e06105fc8c873a","text":"6 instances in us-east-1a and 6 instances in us-east-1b","correct":false},{"id":"35e98ea97449addda5a6f1eecf072e4a","text":"6 instances in us-east-1a and 1 instance in us-east-1b","correct":false},{"id":"205a5d33fbfbd8a66d4bbd686e7455b9","text":"3 instances in us-east-1a and 3 instances in us-east-1b","correct":false},{"id":"df38b78549933ce6cdce41ce65a061ba","text":"1 instance in us-east-1a and 1 instance in us-east-1b","correct":true}]},{"id":"0c35721a-5f70-44fa-b450-3a734cffe32d","domain":"development","question":"You are working on an application which runs inside a Docker container.

There are two ARNs associated with this initial version, the qualified ARN which is the function ARN plus a version suffix e.g. $LATEST. Or the unqualified ARN which is the function ARN without the version suffix. The function version for an unqualified function always maps to $LATEST, so you can access the latest version using either the qualified ARN with $LATEST, or the unqualified function ARN.

Lambda is generally for short-lived functions which do not persist, so is not suitable for managing session state. Glacier is designed for archiving infrequently used data so is not suitable for session data which could be frequently used for the lifetime of the session and then no longer required. In order to address scalability and to provide a shared data storage for sessions that can be accessed from any individual web server, you can abstract the HTTP sessions from the web servers themselves. A common solution to for this is to leverage an In-Memory Key/Value store such as Redis and Memcached, and in AWS the service to use is ElastiCache.","links":[{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/caching/session-management/","title":"Session Management"}],"answers":[{"id":"4def2a084469f97f6372bfaf0823941b","text":"Glacier","correct":false},{"id":"18a293ade3b7503fb165b9b2805ed819","text":"EC2 instance EBS volume","correct":false},{"id":"04f055bdce7b135b43773f720d011d7c","text":"EC2 instance memory","correct":false},{"id":"50848259480914860b338e7baf94c29a","text":"ElastiCache","correct":true},{"id":"04a7da3c5b04cad85da1eebb92315b8b","text":"Lambda","correct":false}]},{"id":"a4afc791-647b-40b6-8f2a-29feb6142a0d","domain":"development","question":"ABC corp runs a web application that uses API Gateway to provide their developer customers with access to data. To reduce load on their upstream systems, the ABC corp have enabled API Gateway caching. A small number of developer customers still need access to results directly from the integration endpoint. To prevent all developer customers from bypassing the cache, ABC corp has also enabled the requirement for cache invalidation to require authorization.\n\nWhat must a developer customer do to return a result that is not cached from the API Gateway?","explanation":"Setting a Cache-Control: max-age=0 HTTP header as part of the request tells API Gateway that you want a response directly from the integration endpoint, rather than a cached response. This header can be interpreted as the client stating the maximum age a cached result can be is 0 seconds - equivalent to saying it cannot be cached at all.\n\nAs the cache is configured to require authorization to be invalidated, the request must be signed with a user or role that allows the execute-api:InvalidateCache action to be performed on the API Gateway resource. An example of this policy is found in the documentation for API Gateway Caching. We have also included a link to how to sign a request using AWS Signature Version 4.\n\nIt is recommended that you require authorization to invalidate a cached response; otherwise, if a significant number of requests perform an invalidation, the cache is no longer helping reduce load on upstream systems.\n\nCalling flush-stage-cache is incorrect because this would delete all data in the entire API cache, rather than just for the response the client has requested.

The choice of database solution depends on the use case and application characteristics. A NoSQL database is suitable when the data is not well-structured to fit into a defined schema, or when the schema changes very often. An RDBMS solution, on the other hand, is suitable when transactions happen across multiple table rows and the queries require complex joins. Amazon DynamoDB would be a better use case in this scenario versus Amazon RDS (which is a SQL-based, structured, relational database solution).
