You are tasked with connecting your on-premises corporate network with AWS network. You have created a VPC in AWS, with an IP CIDR range of 10.0.1.0/16.

If you are setting up a route to your external corporate network from your VPC, the destination must be the CIDR range of your external corporate network. 0.0.0.0/16 is the destination for the open Internet. 10.0.1.0/16 is the CIDR range for your own subnet, which would not work. 192.168.192.168/32 is the instance metadata and would not connect to your corporate network.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html","title":"Route Tables"}],"answers":[{"id":"7b02a9ed0632530a998a9a41da156695","text":"Set the destination CIDR as 172.16.0.0/12 for the traffic in your subnet to go.","correct":true},{"id":"0b4c0e7099a39c83801d4570c9dc6c27","text":"Set the destination CIDR as 0.0.0.0/16 for the traffic in your subnet to go.","correct":false},{"id":"14eecdfdcb09e543dbbaf8bfb2df4e0f","text":"Set the destination CIDR as 192.168.192.168/32 for the traffic in your subnet to go.","correct":false},{"id":"83f6f90763fb37e1a55fafd4ca6ad17c","text":"Set the destination CIDR as 10.0.1.0/16 for the traffic in your subnet to go.","correct":false}]},{"id":"2ed81e01-78af-4ca1-8cc9-2ecfeeff8984","domain":"data-man","question":"Which of the following is not a use case for read replicas?","explanation":"Providing greater redundancy via automatic failovers is not a use case for read replicas.

There are customers in us-west-2, and customers in ap-southeast-1. There is growing demand for the website from customers in ap-southeast-1, and customers have been complaining about poor latency. How would you ensure that users are directed to the Region with the best performance?","explanation":"If your application is hosted in multiple AWS Regions, you can improve performance for your users by serving their requests from the AWS Region that provides the lowest latency. To use latency-based routing, you create latency records for your resources in multiple AWS Regions. When Route 53 receives a DNS query for your domain or subdomain (example.com or acme.example.com), it determines which AWS Regions you've created latency records for, determines which region gives the user the lowest latency, and then selects a latency record for that region. Geolocation may sound like the right answer but it may trick you thinking that the closest Region assumes the lowest latency, but this is not the case. There is no need to separate the website into two Regions as this is an administrative burden. An ALB with HTTP path routing has nothing to do with improving latency.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-latency","title":"Choosing a Routing Policy"}],"answers":[{"id":"4a2ab96fd93984723a369708f83fec95","text":"Configure an Application Load Balancer in front of your website.

Deployments must complete within a limited time window as part of the department's overall DevOps strategy, and AWS CloudFormation will be used for infrastructure-as-code. Which architecture will provide for the fastest deployments in the most operationally efficient manner?","explanation":"Creating an AMI at the time of CloudFormation stack creation or update helps to ensure that the latest binaries are included in an Auto Scaling Launch Configuration while avoiding potentially long waits for Auto Scaling instances to be provisioned. Bootstrapping software downloads during Auto Scaling instance launch will potentially result in long wait times. Using CloudFormation metadata to indicate which software binaries need to be used in Auto Scaling Launch Configurations is not supported functionality.

NAT Gateways have a cost per hour, even if they are not actively processing traffic - If they are processing traffic, this traffic is an extra charge. Any public IP that is not actively associated with an instance incurs as small monthly charge - this is done by AWS to encourage you to release any IPs that are not in use as there is a limited supply. VPCs themselves do not incur charges, though their contents often do. An SQS que that is not receiving any traffic will not incur any cost, and with Internet Gateways you only pay for the traffic that is processed - Unlike NAT Gateways there is no charge for simply having one there.

The CRON expression requires the instance to provide its public IP address to pass to another application running on a second EC2 instance. How would you obtain the IP address?","explanation":"Because your instance metadata is available from your running instance, you do not need to use the Amazon EC2 console or the AWS CLI. This can be helpful when you're writing scripts to run from your instance. For example, you can access the local IP address of your instance from instance metadata to manage a connection to an external application. User data are the parameters you specify when configuring your instance.

Your team's application runs on a load balanced pool of web servers and needs to store frequently changing data like buffers, caches, and other interim data. What AWS storage solution would you recommend to maximize performance and minimize costs?","explanation":"An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance store is ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers.

Minimizing operational costs is a priority, so they've decided to store the application's data on AWS. Which storage solution will be the most cost effective?","explanation":"A Storage Gateway Volume Gateway in cached mode uses S3 as it's primary storage and caches frequently accessed data locally. A Volume Gateway in cached mode will be more cost effective than one in stored mode because only 20% of the storage capacity needs to be purchased for the on-premises Storage Gateway server in cached mode, whereas the full storage capacity needs to be purchased for a stored mode gateway. Amazon EFS Standard storage is currently $0.30 per GB per month, whereas Storage Gateway Volume Gateway pricing is currently $0.023 per GB per month.

What is the most likely cause?","explanation":"When an instance is seen to be terminating and relaunching regularly (commonly known as 'flapping' or 'thrashing'), the most likely cause is that the Autoscaling group is marking the instance as unhealthy to trigger a replacement.  This can be caused if the Load Balancer health check has been improperly configured- for instance if a missing security group rules means the ALB cannot perform health checks. or the health check too aggressively marks instances as unhealthy before launch has completed (i.e. before userdata has finished.  Termination of an autoscaling instance when using Spot fleet is common, but to see the regular launch and termination would suggest this is health-check related rather than due to spot price changes.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/healthcheck.html#health-check-grace-period","title":"EC2 AutoScaling - Replacing Unhealthy Instances"}],"answers":[{"id":"22b774b395936efd71fe7ddaf41a3f8a","text":"The autoscaling health check is marking the instance as unhealthy before it has time to initalise fully.","correct":false},{"id":"18d69cdccb048f832573792064f79345","text":"There is a temporary outage in the AWS Autoscaling service in that region.","correct":false},{"id":"ef10fce024d97295098b2e7c8b9de34e","text":"The Launch Configuration is using an unsupported AMI for your Availability Zone.","correct":true},{"id":"ceb2643dc2123b2807f446e103bad7ff","text":"The price for the EC2 spot instance has increased to above the maximum price for your autoscaling group Launch Configuration.","correct":false}]},{"id":"daea596c-77ce-4763-bc26-c7eabbeb3fed","domain":"automation","question":"The CTO of an e-commerce company has mandated the use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) services and tools to manage the application resources and processes.
