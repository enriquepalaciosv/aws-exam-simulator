The most current version of Windows will require a large capital investment to purchase more powerful hardware to run it. All desktops/laptops require access to the Internet as well as access to multiple business applications running on Amazon EC2 web servers in the AWS cloud.

Which architecture will provide the most cost effective solution?","explanation":"Amazon Workspaces provides the capability to serve virtual cloud-based desktop sessions to your desktop/laptop users (either Windows or Linux). It eliminates the need for powerful hardware, and it removes the burden of individual desktop/laptop software maintenance. AppStream is not needed to access the Internet, nor is it needed to serve the EC2 applications in this use case since a browser can be used from WorkSpaces to access the web servers. A NAT Gateway is preferred to an Internet Gateway since all traffic is initiated from the desktop/laptop, instead of from out on the Internet.

NAT Gateway is a highly-available and redundant service managed by AWS and optimized for handling NAT traffic. On the other hand, high-availability, redundancy, maintenance, and performance optimization must all be managed by the client for NAT instances.
