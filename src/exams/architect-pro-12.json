The devices send data to both AWS IoT Core and Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Kinesis Data Streams triggers a Lambda function to format the data, and then forwards it to AWS IoT Analytics to perform monitoring and time-series analyses, and to take actions based on business processes. After an equipment failure on one of the manufacturing lines causes tens of thousands of dollars in revenue losses, it's determined that alarms for a specific piece of equipment where received seventy-five seconds after the issue originated, and that automated corrective action within a few seconds of the problem could have avoided the financial losses altogether. What changes should be made to the architecture to improve the latency of device alerts?","explanation":"AWS IoT Analytics is useful for understanding long-term device performance, performing business reporting, and identifying predictive fleet maintenance needs, but common latencies run from seconds to minutes. If you need to analyze IoT data in real-time for device monitoring, use Kinesis Data Analytics, which provides latencies in the millisecond to seconds range. A Lambda function can be used as the destination for Kinesis Data Analytics to perform corrective actions. IoT Core rules can write messages to a Kinesis stream, but not directly to Kinesis Data Analytics. Having a Lambda function perform anomaly detection will work, but will require more logic to be written for query setup and execution than using a specialized service like Kinesis Data Analytics. With Amazon CloudWatch Alarms, an alarm will watch a single metric over a period time, but will not provide the capabilities of SQL to detect complex anomaly conditions.","links":[{"url":"https://d1.awsstatic.com/architecture-diagrams/ArchitectureDiagrams/aws-reference-architecture-time-series-processing.pdf?did=wp_card&trk=wp_card","title":"Processing IoT Time Series Data on AWS"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/iot-analytics/faq/","title":"AWS IoT Analytics FAQs"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/05/introducing-real-time-iot-device-monitoring-with-kinesis-data-analytics/","title":"Introducing Real-Time IoT Device Monitoring with Kinesis Data Analytics"}],"answers":[{"id":"fe8ff20697982ca413f81ea14472e603","text":"Add Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics as a second consumer of the Kinesis Data Stream to detect anomalies in the data.

Anyone can make a call to this REST service and receive up-to-date information on forecasted sun flare or sun spots that might have an electromagnetic impact here on Earth.  You are in the final stages of developing this new serverless application based on DynamoDB, Lambda and API Gateway.

The exact nature of the testing is not explained but we can anticipate a few causes.  If you have enabled API Gateway caching, the gateway can return a result from its cache without having to go back to a supplying service or database.  This can result in various response rates depending on if an item is in the cache or not.  (The question did not specify we had slow response...just inconsistent response which could be a response faster than we expected.)  When a Lambda function is run for the first time or after an update, AWS must provision the Lambda environment and pull in any external dependencies.  This can result in a slower response time at first but faster later.  Also, if we do not have sufficient RCU for our DynamoDB table, we could run into throttling of the reads which could appear as inconsistent response times.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/running-lambda-code.html","title":"AWS Lambda Execution Context - AWS Lambda"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-caching.html","title":"Enable API Caching to Enhance Responsiveness - Amazon API Gateway"}],"answers":[{"id":"4c3254ba1ddb0fb7a3ce3824707a7105","text":"You have enabled caching on the API Gateway.","correct":true},{"id":"4922e0fbbf140cd0dbb6458bbadbf268","text":"The data is being updated on DynamoDB at the exact same time you are trying to read it.","correct":false},{"id":"43fb818a88f47b6b3b136abdd40a15a6","text":"There are not enough open inbound ports in your VPC.","correct":false},{"id":"158838df2d14636ed1429fffbcc6825e","text":"Your DynamoDB RCUs are underprovisioned.","correct":true},{"id":"f13e59f5ef22ace9340e24f434eb09cb","text":"You are experiencing a cold start.","correct":true},{"id":"3bd10d778b04bfa32a7338a04e832d38","text":"The CloudFront distribution used by API Gateway is not deployed fully yet.","correct":false},{"id":"b03fe2e16e6904dc4b5fa34c91c1f855","text":"You are using HTTP rather than HTTPS.","correct":false}]},{"id":"33803c8a-b588-4dca-8067-e500383254f3","domain":"awscsapro-domain4","question":"You work for a retail services company that has 8 S3 buckets in us-east-1 region. Some of the buckets have a lot of objects in them. There are Lambda functions and EC2-hosted custom application code where the names of these buckets are hardcoded. Your manager is worried about disaster recovery. As part of her business continuity plan, she has requested you to set up Cross-Region Replication of these S3 buckets to us-west-1, ensuring that the replicated objects are using a less expensive Storage Class because they would not be accessed unless disaster strikes. You are worried that in the event of failover due to the entire us-east-1 region being unavailable, the application code, once deployed in us-west-1, must continue to work while trying to access the S3 buckets in the new region. She has also requested you to start taking periodic snapshots of EBS Volumes and make these snapshots available in the us-west-1 region so that EC2 instances can be launched in us-west-1 using these snapshots if needed. How would you ensure that (a) the launching of EC2 instances works in us-west-1 and (b) your application code works with the us-west-1 S3 buckets?","explanation":"This question presents two problems - (1) how to ensure that EBS snapshots are created periodically and are also made available in a different region for launching required EC2 instances in case of failure of the primary region (2) how to deal with application code where S3 bucket names are hardcoded and whether this hardcoding will impact disaster recovery while trying to run in a different region. Both of these problems are real-life issues AWS customers face when designing and planning their disaster recovery solutions.\n(1)Remember that Data Lifecycle Manager can only schedule snapshot creation in the same Region. If we want to copy that snapshot into a different region, we must write our own scripts or Lambda functions for doing that. Hence, the choices that state that DLM can be used to directly create the snapshot into different regions are eliminated. Additionally, only root volume snapshots can be used to create an AMI. Non-root EBS Volume snapshots cannot be used to generate an AMI. Hence, the choices that specify using non-root volume snapshots are eliminated.\n(2)Remember that S3 bucket names are globally unique. Hence, one cannot create a second S3 bucket in the DR Region with the same name as the bucket in the primary region. Hence, the options that hint the creation of S3 buckets by the same name are eliminated. This results in a problem if S3 names are hardcoded in the application - that application will simply not run in a new region, it will fail. Hence, it is best to avoid hardcoding, and fetch the S3 bucket name from a key-value storage service like AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store at runtime. Creating this Parameter Store in each region and storing the correct bucket names in them can help in designing this non-hardcoded solution. Additionally, enabling Cross-Region Replication does not copy pre-existing content. Hence, the choices that suggest that pre-existing content will be automatically copied are eliminated.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-launch-snapshot.html","title":"Launching an Instance from a Backup"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/copy-snapshot.html","title":"Copy-snapshot documentation"}],"answers":[{"id":"02e8aed40d51e4bf9256f1ed436aa069","text":"To ensure that EC2 instances can be launched in us-west-1 when needed, schedule periodic creation of EBS snapshots of both root and non-root volumes using Data Lifecycle Manager such that the snapshots are created directly in us-west-1 region.

Hence, the question actually is just about knowing the ways KMS Keys can be used - they can either be customer-managed, or AWS managed or both AWS and customer-managed.\nAnother aspect tested by the question is whether to use Task Role or EC2 Instance Role while granting an ECS Cluster permission to access resources during container execution. AWS recommends using the Task Role in this scenario, hence we can eliminate the two choices that specify using EC2 Instance Roles.\nThe option that says that the encryption key must only be stored by the customer is incorrect, as we can use KMS to store the key. The options that state the only supported management options for the KMS-stored keys are either only customer-managed or only AWS managed are both incorrect.

The firm has a website which end-users can use to apply for loans and also track the status of their loan application if they log in. When a loan application comes in, several downstream systems need to independently process the application. Right now, the website server-side code invokes these systems one after the other, synchronously, in a tight loop. If one of these downstream systems times out or throws an exception, the entire loan application processing errors out. Even if none of these downstream systems fail, the time it takes to process a loan application is very high due to the serial nature of these systems being invoked. Your CTO wants only the loan-processing application moved to the AWS cloud and re-architected at the same time.\nThe downstream systems are all hosted on-premises and will continue to remain on-premises. They expose REST endpoints that accept POST HTTPS requests, use self-signed certificates and respond synchronously only when they are done processing an application. After re-architecture, all downstream systems must independently start processing an incoming loan application simultaneously.\nYour CTO wants to know how the loan-processing website application can be architected in the AWS Cloud, and what supporting changes will be needed in the downstream systems on-premises. He wants to minimize code changes to the downstream on-premises systems. Choose the best option","explanation":"This is an example of a verbose question with verbose answer choices. You can expect a few such questions in the exam, testing your time management skills. Try to vertically scan the answers to see which parts differ between them. Sometimes, though the answers seem big, a large part of each is identical. You can ignore those parts, as there is nothing to choose between the.\nAmong the four choices, two use SQS and two use SNS to feed the incoming loan applications to the downstream systems. You cannot automatically eliminate either SQS or SNS, as a working solution can be designed with either.\nLet us see how we can achieve this using SNS first. The basic requirement here is fan-out - a single loan application must be processed by several downstream systems, so there are multiple consumers. Hence, SNS is a natural fit. SNS supports multiple subscribers for a topic. SNS also supports HTTP/HTTPS subscribers. SNS makes POST REST API call to as many HTTP/HTTPS subscribers exist on the topic, so it fits the bill. However, there is a small problem - the requirement states that the downstream systems must be changed as little as possible. If we follow this design, we must change the HTTP Listening part of the downstream systems significantly. Because SNS is directly calling them now, SNS will use its own headers and body format. In fact, SNS POST-s two kinds of messages - one is Subscription Confirmation and one is Notification. A special HTTP header (x-amz-sns-message-type) has the right type in its value. The server side now must parse this header out and look for only the Notification type of message. The body itself will then be JSON formatted with the payload. While the server is probably used to process just the core payload (loan application data) as the HTTP body, the same will now be hidden inside a JSON field called Message inside the request body. Additionally, the downstream systems will have to deal with SNS retries, thus the loan application part must be made idempotent (if the same loan application lands twice, it will ignore the duplicates). Thus, though it is technically possible to design the solution using SNS, it will result in a lot of changes in the downstream systems. Hence, though the SNS option will work, it is not the correct answer because of this reason.\nNow, let us see how we can design this using SQS. While SQS does not support fan-out (multiple consumers for the same message), the proposed solution uses a Lambda function to achieve fan-out. The Lambda function will pick up the message, and then call the downstream systems one by one. The key to making this work is, of course, to modify the downstream systems from synchronous monolithic beasts to asynchronous servers so that they can instantly respond to the Lambda function and then continue to process the application. We will then have to provide a callback for when it is done. The solution uses an API Gateway for that purpose. Overall, the solution is elegant, and changes to the downstream systems are less than what SNS requires. Hence, SQS is the correct answer.\nNote that one version of the SNS design proposes to retain the synchronous nature of the downstream systems. That will not work as SNS will not wait more than 15 seconds for a response. The response will then be lost and the main website app will never know the results from the downstream systems.\nAlso, note that though SNS requires the HTTPS subscriber to present a trusted CA-signed certificate, there is no such requirement for Lambda because Lambda is basically your code, you can decide to trust anyone.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-http-https-endpoint-as-subscriber.html","title":"Using Amazon SNS for System-to-System Messaging with an HTTP/S Endpoint as a Subscriber"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html","title":"Using AWS Lambda with Amazon SQS"}],"answers":[{"id":"48d42d3290142cbfc8207e042690b35f","text":"For the website that accepts loan applications, run it on EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group spanning multiple Availability Zones with an Elastic Load Balancer.

Users can also raise disputes if anything is incorrect. This 2-tier website that supports only HTTPS will be moved to the AWS Cloud. There are 5 web servers on-premises and an F5 Load Balancer that controls traffic to these web servers. SSL is terminated at the web servers. An Oracle Real Application Cluster (RAC) serves as the database tier.

Additionally, AWS ELB does not support terminating client-side certificates.

This requires the protocol to be TCP/443. Both these facts (one, SSL is not terminated at the Load Balancer level, and two, mutual authentication is used) are stated explicitly in the question so that the candidate identifies at least one of them and is thus able to conclude that HTTPS is not the correct protocol choice for ELB. Hence, amongst the two choices that use ELB, the one that says TCP is the correct one.\nSecondly, RDS does not support Oracle RAC. Hence, the database tier must use EC2 instances.

The catalog contains over 6,000 products. They'd like to offer a product search engine on the website using Amazon Elasticsearch Service. They'll use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to perform the initial load of the Elasticsearch indexes, and to handle change data capture (CDC) going forward. During the initial load of the indexes, the DMS job terminates with an Elasticsearch return code of 429 and a message stating 'Too many requests'. What must be done to load the Elasticsearch indexes successfully?","explanation":"When the ElasticSearch indexing queue is full, a 429 response code is returned and an es_rejected_execution_exception is thrown. The DMS load task then terminates. Throttling the DMS input stream based on the number of Elasticsearch indexes, shards, and replicas to be loaded will result in a successfully completed job. The DMS MaxFullLoadSubTasks parameter indicates how many source tables to load in parallel, and the ParallelLoadThreads parameter determines the number of threads that can be allocated for a given table. Increasing Elasticsearch shards without modifying DMS subtask and thread parameters could still overrun the request queue. Changing the DMS stream buffer count won't help with this issue. Amazon Elasticsearch currently doesn't provide support for AWS Glue as a source, so integration would require significant effort.

They host their customer database and billing application on IBM mainframes. IBM AIX servers running WebSphere provide an API layer into the mainframes. Customer-facing online applications are hosted on Linux systems. The customer service backend application resides on Oracle Solaris and makes use of gigabytes of persistent information. Their ERP and CRM systems also run on Solaris boxes. Telecom switches send call records to Linux-based applications, and their employee productivity suite runs on Windows. They need to complete the project in twelve months to satisfy budgetary constraints. Which migration strategy will provide them with the most resilient, scalable, and operationally efficient cloud environment within the project time frame?","explanation":"Since the company has twelve months to complete the project, they can plan for a highly cloud-centric migration. Refactoring the mainframe billing application to EC2 and the customer database to Aurora will require significant cost and effort, but will result in significant intermediate to long-term business value for most companies. A number of AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions are available to assist with this. The WebSphere layer can be replaced by API Gateway with HTTP, REST, or WebSocket APIs that call modules on the EC2 instances. Refactoring the customer-facing online apps to Lambda serverless and Step Functions will provide high operational efficiency. Performing a replatform of the Solaris customer service application to EC2 with Auto Scaling will achieve elasticity to avoid the excess capacity inefficiencies that were most-likely present in the on-premises environment. Many robust ERP, CRM, and employee productivity SaaS solutions exist and should be leveraged rather than trying to manage these applications with in-house staff. The call record processing Linux system can simply be rehosted to EC2. Repurchasing mainframe capacity from a third party provider only extends the rigidness of making mainframe changes whenever new business requirements arise. A Lambda/Step Functions solution will provide all the functionality needed for the online apps, and will be more economical than Elastic Beanstalk. Refactoring the customer service application to Lambda presents issues with processing the gigabytes of persistent information, so replatforming to EC2 is a better choice.","links":[{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/6-strategies-for-migrating-applications-to-the-cloud/","title":"6 Strategies for Migrating Applications to the Cloud"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/automated-refactoring-of-a-new-york-times-mainframe-to-aws-with-modern-systems/","title":"Automated Refactoring of a New York Times Mainframe to AWS with Modern Systems"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/","title":"Build a Serverless Web Application"}],"answers":[{"id":"290da60b3bdd11f28e175fa86972386a","text":"Repurchase mainframe capacity from a third party provider and run the customer database and billing application there.

The applications running in the VPC access, store and process sensitive customer information by reading from and writing to both the S3 buckets. The company is also using a hybrid approach and has several workloads running on-premises. The on-premises datacenter is connected to their AWS VPC using Direct Connect.\nYou have proposed that an S3 VPC Endpoint be created to access the two S3 buckets from the VPC so that sensitive customer data is not exposed to the internet.\nSelect two correct statements from the following that relate to designing this solution using VPC Endpoint.","explanation":"S3 VPC Endpoint is a common topic tested in the SA-P Exam, as it enables S3 access over a private network, which is a common security requirement in many organizations.

That is because if there are 2 or 3 or 4 closely worded choices, only one (or in some rare cases, two) is correct - this is a common pattern in the SA-P test.\nFor the closely worded pair - the bucket policy of an S3 bucket will always specify who can or cannot access the bucket. It will not dictate how a VPC Endpoint behaves. Hence, the choice that suggests that a bucket policy can control a VPC Endpoint is incorrect.\nBetween the other two choices, remember that a VPC Endpoint can connect to any number of S3 buckets by default. One Endpoint for each bucket is simply not scalable, and should stand out as incorrect.\nThe remaining choice is correct because the S3 VPC Endpoint is of type Gateway Endpoint as opposed to Interface Endpoint, and a subnet needs Routes in the Routing Table for sources in the subnet to be able to connect to it.

You notice that there are several existing roles called role-engineer, role-manager, role-qa, role-dba, role-data-scientist, etc. When a new person joins the company, the new IAM user simply assumes the right role while using AWS - this allows central management of permissions and eliminates the need to manage permissions on a per-user basis.\nA new QA hire joins the company a few days later.

First, the Policy attached to the User must allow the action STS AssumeRole. This is already true according to the question. Second, the Trust Policy of the Role itself must allow the User in question to assume the Role. This second condition can be met if we specify the arn of the User in the Principal element of the Trust Policy.

The scripts perform some aggregation on the data and import the aggregate into their Oracle database.  They want to move this process to AWS as well.  Which option would be the most cost-effective way for them to do this?","explanation":"AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, translate and loading service and is compatible with Scala.  EMR could do this but represents more overhead than necessary.  Lambda is not compatible with Scala and migrating to Redshift does not bring anything in this case if the customer wants to retain their Oracle database.","links":[{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/glue/faqs/","title":"AWS Glue Features - Amazon Web Services"}],"answers":[{"id":"04578ae8419780f9dc441d01fe11582d","text":"Create Lambda functions using your Scala scripts.","correct":false},{"id":"a445a1a877009cd7c31858687a818116","text":"Import your Scala scripts into AWS SCT for processing.","correct":false},{"id":"4f1ff8b853c3ba363bdd2bda53538ab4","text":"Migrate from Oracle to Redshift and use Kinesis Firehose.","correct":false},{"id":"8b01d948d5ad2f4b1c8e817c2d98e7c2","text":"Migrate the processing to AWS Glue.","correct":true},{"id":"1a4de6676c8c078310e08aad71d9dce6","text":"Migrate the processing to AWS EMR.","correct":false}]},{"id":"c01346c8-d230-4b52-b53d-78cdbfbc7794","domain":"awscsapro-domain4","question":"You work for an Insurance Company as an IT Architect. The development team for a microservices-based claim-processing system has created containerized applications to run on ECS. They have spun up a Fargate ECS cluster in their development VPC inside a private subnet. The containerized application uses awslogs driver to send logs to Cloudwatch. The ECS task definition files use private ECR images that are pulled down to ensure that the latest image is running always. The cluster is having connectivity problems as it cannot seem to connect with ECR to pull the latest images and neither can it connect with Cloudwatch to log. The development team has approached you to help troubleshoot the issue. What is a possible reason for this and what is the best way to fix it?","explanation":"ECS Fargate clusters can be deployed in a private subnet. Hence, we can safely eliminate the choice that says that ECS Fargate clusters must be deployed in a public subnet only.\nECS Fargate clusters do not need the user to control the ECS Agent Version on the nodes, as Fargate is serverless by design. Hence, we can safely eliminate the choice that deals with ECS Agent Version.\nThis leaves two options. One proposes using NAT Gateway. The other proposes using ECS Interface VPC Endpoint. Both are working solutions. However, one of them makes a false claim - it states that ECS Fargate clusters connect to ECR or Cloudwatch only over the internet. That is not true, as it can connect either using a public or a private network. Hence, the only fully correct choice is the one that uses ECS Interface VPC Endpoint","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/vpc-endpoints.html","title":"Amazon ECS Interface VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/setting-up-aws-privatelink-for-amazon-ecs-and-amazon-ecr/","title":"Setting up AWS PrivateLink for Amazon ECR"}],"answers":[{"id":"d73a8a48aaef0ddbe725f06264c3c6a3","text":"ECS Fargate clusters can connect to ECR (to pull down latest private images) or Cloudwatch (to log) only over the internet.
