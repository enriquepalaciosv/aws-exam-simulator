You have workloads running on Amazon EC2 in ten different AWS accounts and in three AWS regions. Resolving the audit deficiency requires the creation of a centralized log monitoring capability for the AWS-based applications and infrastructure, and for certain on-premises systems that they interface with. You've been tasked with creating an automated solution that will satisfy the auditors. Which architecture will you implement for the solution?","explanation":"Amazon Elasticsearch is a fully managed service that lets you collect and analyze logs and metrics, giving you a comprehensive view into your applications and infrastructure, reducing mean time to detect (MTTD) and resolve (MTTR) issues. Amazon CloudWatch collects API events from CloudTrail, networking events from VPC Flow Logs, and application and system logs from EC2 instances via the CloudWatch Logs agent. Using a single CloudWatch log group ensures that system logs share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings. Lambda functions in each account can move log data from CloudWatch into Elasticsearch for indexing and visualization with Kibana. CloudWatch log streams are sequences of events from the same source, whereas a log group is a collection of log streams. Logstash works well for collecting logs, but is usually paired with Elasticsearch for log monitoring and analysis.

Your colleagues have been defining infrastructure in a test account but now they are ready to deploy into production, they are identifying some problems.  They have have attempted to deploy the main CloudFormation Template but they are seeing the following errors; 'Invalid Value or Unsupported Resource Property', 'Resource Failed to Stabilize' and when these errors are encountered, the stack fails to rollback cleanly.  Assist your team by choosing the best ways to troubleshoot these problems.","explanation":"Most of these answers are valid troubleshooting solutions for various CloudFormation issues, but there is only one answer for the problems listed in the question. 'Invalid Value or Unsupported Resource Property' errors appear only if there is a parameter naming mistake or that the property names are unsupported. 'Resource Failed to Stabilize' errors appear because a timeout is exceeded, the AWS service isn't available or is interrupted.  Finally, any update which fails to rollback could be because of a number of reasons, but the most popular is due to the deployment account having permissions to create stacks, but not to modify or delete stacks.

Select the correct answer that describes the best way to proceed.","explanation":"Secrets Manager already natively knows how to rotate secrets for supported Amazon RDS databases. However, it also can enable you to rotate secrets for other databases or third-party services. It provides a secure API that enables the programmatic retrieval of secrets to ensure that it can't be compromised by someone examining your code and configurations stored in a version control system. Secrets Manager invokes the secrets rotation Lambda function each time with the same secretId and clientTokenRequest. Only the Step parameter changes with each call.

It can't be a database engine issue, because replication will only run on a transactional engine like InnoDB.  Deleting and recreating the read replicas can resolve an issue, but only if there are data inconsistencies and performing only that operation, means that those errors will come back.
