Your CEO likes the direction AWS are taking the cloud industry and has suggested you look into what it would take to migrate your servers to the cloud. All of your servers are built and configured automatically using Chef. Which AWS services will you transition your first batch of servers to AWS in the FASTEST possible way while maintaining a centralised configuration management?","explanation":"While AWS OpsWorks allows you to use your own custom chef cookbooks with your AWS resources, it is not as easy as simply importing your existing servers into OpsWorks.

How can you achieve this?","explanation":"When a canary deployment preference is used, traffic will be shifted in two increments. Various available options specify the percentage of traffic that's shifted to the updated Lambda function version in the first increment, and the interval, in minutes, before the remaining traffic is shifted in the second increment.

You have 3 AWS Accounts; 'POC' allows for Developers to stand up new technology and try out new ideas on an adhoc basis. 'QA' allows for automated builds and testing to be carried out as part of your CI/CD Pipeline and any problems here mean that software will not get pushed into production, so it's important that any issues are resolved quickly. The final account is 'Live' which is the main Production account.  It's the most critical and requires the best response times.  You need to choose the most appropriate and cost effective Support Plan which will satisfy your support needs but also allow for the full range of AWS Trusted Advisor Checks and Recommendations.","explanation":"The important phrase in the question is that any choice must \"...allow for the full range of AWS Trusted Advisor Checks and Recommendations\", only two support plans have all the Trust Advisor checks and these are Business and Enterprise.  Anything that contains the Basic or Developer plans will not be correct.  Also, it specifies that the 'Live' account is \"critical and requires the best possible response times\", so we could use the Enterprise plan for this, but we'll only get better response time for mission critical business applications such as Microsoft, SAP and Oracle tools, which is not the software we are deploying.
