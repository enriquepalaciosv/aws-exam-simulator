Choose options from the list which will meet the requirements of rewriting the template.","explanation":"Intrinsic functions can not be used within the Parameters section and so these options can be immediately ruled out.

ASI also specifies an internal ELB for load balancing between the Jira instances, and to be used as an SSL termination reverse proxy. An ELB Application Load Balancer accomplishes this. Jira applications are installed on EC2 instances in the private subnets and joined to an Auto Scaling Group. Jira requires a supported relational database, and Aurora PostgreSQL is supported for Jira Data Center. Jira applications use a shared file system to store artifacts in a common location, and EFS fulfills this requirement.
