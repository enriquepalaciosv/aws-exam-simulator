As part of an outreach and education program, the company has financed the construction of a free public service that provides weather forecasts for the sun.  Anyone can make a call to this REST service and receive up-to-date information on forecasted sun flare or sun spots that might have an electromagnetic impact here on Earth.  You are in the final stages of developing this new serverless application based on DynamoDB, Lambda and API Gateway.  During performance testing, you notice inconsistent response times for the service.  You had expected the API to be relatively consistent since its just retrieving data from DynamoDB and returning it as JSON via the API Gateway.  What might account for this variation in response time?","explanation":"Inconsistent response times can have a few different causes.  The exact nature of the testing is not explained but we can anticipate a few causes.  If you have enabled API Gateway caching, the gateway can return a result from its cache without having to go back to a supplying service or database.  This can result in various response rates depending on if an item is in the cache or not.  (The question did not specify we had slow response...just inconsistent response which could be a response faster than we expected.)  When a Lambda function is run for the first time or after an update, AWS must provision the Lambda environment and pull in any external dependencies.  This can result in a slower response time at first but faster later.  Also, if we do not have sufficient RCU for our DynamoDB table, we could run into throttling of the reads which could appear as inconsistent response times.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/running-lambda-code.html","title":"AWS Lambda Execution Context - AWS Lambda"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-caching.html","title":"Enable API Caching to Enhance Responsiveness - Amazon API Gateway"}],"answers":[{"id":"f13e59f5ef22ace9340e24f434eb09cb","text":"You are experiencing a cold start.","correct":true},{"id":"4c3254ba1ddb0fb7a3ce3824707a7105","text":"You have enabled caching on the API Gateway.","correct":true},{"id":"43fb818a88f47b6b3b136abdd40a15a6","text":"There are not enough open inbound ports in your VPC.","correct":false},{"id":"158838df2d14636ed1429fffbcc6825e","text":"Your DynamoDB RCUs are underprovisioned.","correct":true},{"id":"4922e0fbbf140cd0dbb6458bbadbf268","text":"The data is being updated on DynamoDB at the exact same time you are trying to read it.","correct":false},{"id":"3bd10d778b04bfa32a7338a04e832d38","text":"The CloudFront distribution used by API Gateway is not deployed fully yet.","correct":false},{"id":"b03fe2e16e6904dc4b5fa34c91c1f855","text":"You are using HTTP rather than HTTPS.","correct":false}]},{"id":"e8bba7f5-4c0d-42dd-ad7a-74f042ce3dd9","domain":"awscsapro-domain3","question":"Due to a dispute with their co-location hosting company, your client is forced to move some applications as soon as possible to AWS.  The main application uses IBM DB2 for the data store layer and a Java process on AIX which interacts via JMS with IBM MQ hosted on an AS400.  What is the best course of action to reduce risk and allow for fast migration?","explanation":"For a fast migration with minimal risk, we would be looking for a lift-and-shift approach and not spend any time on re-architecting or re-platforming that we don't absolutely have to do.

Management has decided to move the two leased data centres to the AWS cloud - one to us-east-1 and the other to us-west-1. The on-premises data centre will still continue running workloads which are not ready to move to the cloud.\nThis on-premises data centre must be always connected to the VPC-s in us-east-1 and us-west-1 for (a) the continuous replication of several databases and (b) the need to access some data residing on the on-premises data centre from applications running in both the AWS regions. The peak bandwidth required for these connections is (a) 500 Mbps between us-east-1 and on-premises, and (b) 8 Gbps between us-west-1 and on-premises. The applications would still be able to function at lower bandwidth, but the experience will be poor, which is not desirable. Both these connections must be Highly Available with 99.999% uptime. The connectivity solution must be cost-effective as well.\nAs the AWS Architect, what connectivity solution would you propose, so that all Bandwidth, HA and cost-effectiveness requirements are met?","explanation":"We can eliminate the VPC Peering solution immediately, as VPC Peering is for connecting two VPC-s on AWS. VPC Peering cannot be used to connect an AWS VPC with an on-premises network.\nOut of the remaining choices, the one that proposes connecting to us-east-1 using VPN and us-west-1 using Direct Connect comes very close to fulfilling all requirements. It suffers from two problems, however. One - the peak bandwidth requirement for us-east-1 is 500 Mbps. A VPN connection cannot be expected to provide 500 Mbps most of the time, as the true bandwidth someone can get from a VPN connection depends on a lot of factors including internet traffic it is sharing the route with. Secondly, if we are paying for a Direct Connect connection for the other region anyway, why not just use that one for this region too? Now, there is something called Direct Connect Gateways that makes it possible to share multiple AWS Regions using the same Direct Connect connection. The knowledge of Direct Connect Gateways is important for the AWS SA-P exam. Hence, this question tests this knowledge. The correct answer is the only one that uses Direct Connect Gateway.\nThe other choice that uses two separate Direct COnnect connections (one for each region) is not cost-effective, especially because since 2017, Direct Connect Gateways make it possible to connect to multiple AWS Regions using the same Direct Connect connection.\nRegarding HA, it is always a good practice to set up a VPN connection as a back-up for Direct Connect. The only requirement to do this is that the back-up VPN connection must also use the same Virtual Private Gateway on the AWS VPC side, otherwise traffic cannot fail over easily.\nNote about Direct Connect Gateways - they not only allow a customer to connect to two AWS Regions using a single Direct Connect connection, they also let the connected Regions communicate with each other! (This is why the VPC CIDR-s in us-east-1 and us-west-1 in the correct answer have to be non-overlapping.) There may be questions testing this aspect as well. Before Direct Connect Gateways existed, VPC Peering would be the only way for Inter-Region VPC Access. There is also another solution now - Transit Gateway, but this was announced late 2018. Usually, topics do not start appearing on the exam unless they have been more than 6 months in GA. Expect Transit Gateways to start appearing in questions now as well!","links":[{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-direct-connect-gateway-inter-region-vpc-access/","title":"AWS Direct Connect Gateway for Inter-Region VPC Access"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/configure-vpn-backup-dx/","title":"Configuring VPN as back up of Direct Connect"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/sla/","title":"Direct Connect SLA puts uptime target at 99.9%.

What AWS service might be able to make this a reality?","explanation":"AWS Rekognition is a service that can detect and match faces in a photograph.

The application leverages a Model-View-Controller architecture with the user interface handled by a Tomcat server and twenty thousand lines of Java Servlet code. Business logic also resides in two thousand lines of PL/SQL stored procedure code in an Oracle database. The company's technology leadership has directed your team to move the database to a more cost-effective offering, and to adopt a more cloud-native architecture. Business objectives dictate that the application must be live in the AWS cloud in sixty days. Which migration approach will provide the most scalable architecture and meet the schedule objectives?","explanation":"This solution will require trade-offs between schedule requirements and architectural desires. Converting twenty thousand lines of Model-View-Controller code to a serverless architecture in sixty days is unreasonable, so moving the Tomcat MVC as-is to EC2 for the initial migration is the best approach. We can migrate to a serverless user interface in a later phase. Database Migration Service will suit our needs well for moving the application data to Aurora, but the most scalable architecture strategy is to migrate the stored procedure code out of the database so that database nodes won't need to be resized when the business logic needs more compute resources. Under normal circumstances, recoding two thousand lines of PL/SQL code to Python Lambda functions within a sixty day time frame will not be a problem.","links":[{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/dms/","title":"AWS Database Migration Service"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/migrate-your-procedural-sql-code-with-the-aws-schema-conversion-tool/","title":"Migrate Your Procedural SQL Code with the AWS Schema Conversion Tool"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/","title":"AWS Lambda"}],"answers":[{"id":"97a348ed01424c357958b49bcc030935","text":"Migrate the Tomcat server and Servlet code to EC2.

Users can also raise disputes if anything is incorrect. This 2-tier website that supports only HTTPS will be moved to the AWS Cloud. There are 5 web servers on-premises and an F5 Load Balancer that controls traffic to these web servers. SSL is terminated at the web servers. An Oracle Real Application Cluster (RAC) serves as the database tier. Due to the sensitive nature of personal health information, the web site uses mutual authentication - the server requests browsers for a valid client certificate before establishing a trusted session.\nSelect two alternate working architectures for this application to be migrated to AWS so that code changes are minimized. Choose two responses each of which can act as an independent and functional solution, and also result in minimum application code changes.","explanation":"The areas tested by this question are as follows.\nFirst, if an ELB is not terminating SSL, its listener protocol cannot be HTTPS - it has to be TCP. Additionally, AWS ELB does not support terminating client-side certificates. Therefore, if a website requires client SSL certificates, and if it also uses AWS ELB, the ELB must let the target EC2 instances to terminate SSL and validate the client certificate. This requires the protocol to be TCP/443. Both these facts (one, SSL is not terminated at the Load Balancer level, and two, mutual authentication is used) are stated explicitly in the question so that the candidate identifies at least one of them and is thus able to conclude that HTTPS is not the correct protocol choice for ELB. Hence, amongst the two choices that use ELB, the one that says TCP is the correct one.\nSecondly, RDS does not support Oracle RAC. Hence, the database tier must use EC2 instances. Thus, for the second alternate solution that uses Route 53 multi-value answer records instead of ELB, we should select the option that deploys EC2 instances for the database tier.","links":[{"url":"https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=109180","title":"Discussion Forums - HTTPS Client certificate validation while using client ELB"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/oracle/faqs/","title":"RDS FAQ-s, search for phrase - Is Oracle RAC supported on Amazon RDS"}],"answers":[{"id":"7250b61db9c9e69abf4f9e7bd2bfb268","text":"Migrate the database to a cluster of EC2 instances and the web servers to EC2 instances.

These files are accessed and downloaded by end-users from all US regions and west EU, though the compressed installation packages are downloaded rarely as users tend to access the service from their browsers instead of installing anything on their machines. Each installation package bundles several images and documents, and also includes binaries that are downloaded from a 3rd party service while creating the package files.\nThe images and documents range from a few KBs to a few hundred KBs in size and they are mostly static in nature. However, the compressed installation package files are generated every few hours because of changes done by the 3rd party service to their binaries, and some of them are as large as a few hundred GB-s. The installation package files can be regenerated from the images and documents fairly quickly if required. It is important to be able to retrieve older versions of the images and documents.\nWhich of the following storage solutions is the most cost-effective approach to design the storage for these files?","explanation":"The areas tested by this question are:\\n1. Versioning cannot be enabled at the object level. It is a bucket-level feature. This rules out the choice where we have a single bucket and selectively turn on versioning on for some objects only.\\n2. If you enable Versioning for a bucket containing large objects that are frequently created/uploaded, it will result in higher storage cost as all the previous versions will result in storage volume growing quickly because of frequent writes. In the given scenario, the compressed installation package files are large and also frequently generated (every few hours). There is no requirement to version them, as they can be quickly generated on-demand. Hence, putting them in a bucket that has Versioning enabled is not a good cost-effective solution. This rules out two choices - one where we have a single versioned bucket, the other where we enable versioning for both buckets.\\n3. Note that all options except one correctly identify the storage class requirements - the compressed installation package files should be stored as One-Zone IA because durability is not a prime requirement for these files (simply because they can be regenerated on-demand easily). They are rarely downloaded, hence IA is the correct class. Combined with low durability, One Zone IA is the most cost-effective solution. Only one option uses the incorrect storage tier for these files - note that IA is more expensive than One-Zone IA, and the question is about cost-effectiveness.\nHence, the only correct answer is the one that addresses both Versioning and Storage Class requirements correctly.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectVersioning.html","title":"Documentation on Object Versioning"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html#sc-howtoset","title":"Setting the Storage Class of an Object"}],"answers":[{"id":"fd1d330daf4d05b4fa4c888a0584130f","text":"Store all three kinds of files in a single S3 bucket.

S3 buckets are being used to serve static content. The API created using API Gateway is protected by WAF. The development team has just staged all components to the QA environment. They are using a load testing tool to generate short bursts of a high number of concurrent requests sent to the API Gateway method. During the load testing, some requests are failing with a response of 504 Endpoint Request Timed-out Exception.\nWhat is one possible reason for this error response from API Gateway endpoint?","explanation":"The SA-P exam sometimes focuses on knowledge of response codes from API Gateway and what each distinct HTTP response code could mean.\nThe key to answering this question correctly is being able to distinguish between 4XX and 5XX HTTP error response codes. Though AWS has not been entirely consistent in their error code assignment philosophy, 4XX usually happens any time throttling kicks in because the request in that case never makes to an instance of Lambda function. 5XX happens when a Lambda function is actually instantiated, but some error (like time out) happened inside the Lambda function. One sneaky way to remember this is the fact that 5XX errors are called server errors in HTTP-land, so to generate a 5XX a server process must exist (and must have failed). Of course, in this context, the HTTP server process is a Lambda function - so in scenarios where throttling prevented a Lambda function from getting spawned, the response code cannot be 5XX. This is not consistently followed by AWS API Gateway error design, though, as we can see that AUTHORIZER_CONFIGURATION_ERROR and AUTHORIZER_FAILURE are both 500, though no Lambda function is actually spawned in either case. However, the candidate must remember that throttling always results in 4XX codes. An Endpoint Request Timed-out Exception (504) suggests that the requests in question actually made its way past the API Gateway into a Lambda function instance.\nFor the scenario where request rate exceeds API Gateway limits, the request would be blocked by API Gateway itself. The response would be 429. The exact knowledge of the code 429, however, is not needed to eliminate this choice. It is expected of the candidate to know that any kind of throttling always results in 4XX response codes, so this choice must be incorrect.\nThe scenario where 1000 Lambda functions are already running is a similar example of throttling - the 1001st Lambda function will not even be spawned. The response, again, will be 429. However, the exact knowledge of the code 429 is not needed to eliminate this choice. It is expected of the candidate to know that any kind of throttling always results in 4XX response codes, so this choice must be incorrect.\nThe WAF scenario is yet another example of the request not even crossing the protections placed at the gateway level. If WAF is activated on API Gateway, it will block requests when the rate exceeds the HTTP flood rate-based rule (provided all such requests come from a single client IP address). However, the response, again, will be in the 4XX area (specifically, 403 Forbidden) - however, the exact knowledge of the code 403 is not needed to eliminate this choice. It is expected of the candidate to know that any kind of throttling always results in 4XX response codes, so this choice must be incorrect.\nThis leaves Lambda time-out as the only correct answer. The mention of 30 seconds or more is a diversion tactic, in case candidate believes that the relevant Lambda time-out is 5 minutes. A given Lambda function instance may have a time-out limit of 5 minutes, but when it is invoked from API Gateway, the timeout imposed by API Gateway is 29 seconds. If a Lambda function runs for longer than 29 seconds, API Gateway will stop waiting for it and return 504 Endpoint Request Timed-out Exception.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/limits.html","title":"Amazon API Gateway Limits and Important Notes"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/amazon-api-gateway-adds-support-for-aws-waf/","title":"Amazon API Gateway adds support for AWS WAF"}],"answers":[{"id":"98daaa701198f7e1c541fe8051799129","text":"The Lambda function is sometimes taking 30 seconds or more to finish executing","correct":true},{"id":"370770015087b4ff70656089fc9e3316","text":"The test is triggering too many Lambda functions concurrently.

In general, this question can be answered if the candidate is familiar with the concept of Principal in a Role, see link - A Principal within an Amazon IAM Role specifies the user (IAM user, federated user, or assumed-role user), AWS account, AWS service, or other principal entity that is allowed or denied to assume or impersonate that Role. Trust Policy is different than the Policy permissions - think of Policy Permissions as [what can be accessed] and Trust Policy as [who can access].\nTrust Policy cannot belong to an IAM User, hence the choice that claims the problem to be an unmodified User Trust Policy is incorrect. IAM changes are instantly effective, so the choice that points at the need of a time delay is also incorrect.
