Each new product event requires that iterative code changes be made during pre-launch preparation based on marketing department feedback and testing results. Slow response times for users have occurred during previous launches, so leadership has directed that load tests be conducted on the e-commerce platform after each new code release. Load testing requires significant time to manually setup and execute, which slows down the development process. You've been tasked with creating an automated load testing service on AWS to shorten testing windows. Which architecture will you recommend to provide scalable load testing capabilities?","explanation":"Simulating thousands of connected users generating a select number of transactions per second can be done without having to provision servers. A test automation framework Docker image deployed on AWS Fargate can be scaled according to user-specified test scenarios. The test scenarios can be created in a web application, and written to S3 and DynamoDB by a Lambda function front-ended by API Gateway. These test scenarios can then be read by another Lambda function to manage Fargate's container scaling to generate the desired load on the e-commerce application. Hosting the web application on Elastic Beanstalk is overkill since test scenarios will probably be entered by a single user for only a short duration of time. S3 configured for static web hosting is a more economical option. Auto Scaling EC2 instances won't generate load according to the specified test scenarios - there's no way to get those scenarios into scaling policies. Running the test automation framework in a Lambda function will risk exceeding Lambda's maximum execution time. AWS Device Farm is used for functionality testing across different browsers and mobile devices, not load testing.","links":[{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/","title":"AWS Fargate"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/distributed-load-testing-on-aws/?did=sl_card&trk=sl_card","title":"Distributed Load Testing on AWS"}],"answers":[{"id":"18ad3b56af5e9d5741987077fd861aca","text":"Implement a web application for creating test scenarios.

Every application has been analysed to see whether it is best hosted on an EC2 instance or as a Lambda function. One particular software project has been rewritten to store an object in an S3 bucket, and then this action triggers a Lambda function to compress the file as a new object in the same bucket, and then delete the original. Unfortunately, due to the way you have deployed the solution the Lambda function appears to be constantly invoking itself and is stuck in a continuous loop.  How do you temporarily stop this from happening whilst you investigate?","explanation":"When architecting a solution, always ensure that you do not generate a recursive loop.  This is when something in one part of the infrastructure will trigger something elsewhere, and in turn trigger the first part once again.  In particular these scenarios are problematic when one AWS service triggers another AWS service and this in turn triggers the first.  In the example, this can only be rectified by enabling the Throttle option, which sets the reserved concurrency to zero and will throttle all future invocations of this function.

They need to increase compute resources based on demand during month-end processing, and decrease them after all reporting has completed to avoid unnecessary costs. Each instance must have a secondary network interface in an isolated subnet for administration tasks in order to meet compliance requirements. How will the company ensure that new instances provisioned by Auto Scaling meet the compliance requirement?","explanation":"Auto Scaling supports adding hooks to the launching and terminating stages of the instance lifecycle. These hooks can send an SNS notification and hold the instance in a pending state waiting for a callback to the API. You can trigger a Lambda function from the SNS topic to create an ENI and attach it to the instance. The lifecycle hook will abandon the instance after a timeout period or if the Lambda function fails. Auto Scaling does not allow for specifying a secondary ENI in the launch configuration. The user data shell script option may work, but there will only be a set number of ENIs available in the pool, whereas the lifecycle hook option creates ENIs as needed.
