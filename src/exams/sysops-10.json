Ensuring the isolation of the VMs running on a hypervisor is not the purpose of AES-256. CMKs are also used for encrypting data but have no part in securing underlying hardware. IAM permissions have nothing to do with the isolation of the VMs running on a hypervisor.

The volume occasionally encounters data consistency errors making the EBS volume inaccessible to the instance. How can this be prevented?","explanation":"When Amazon EBS determines that a volume's data is potentially inconsistent, it disables I/O to the volume from any attached EC2 instances by default. This causes the volume status check to fail, and creates a volume status event that indicates the cause of the failure. Switching on Enable Volume IO will allow the instance to access the volume. Switching on Auto-Enabled IO will also achieve this outcome automatically when enabled.
