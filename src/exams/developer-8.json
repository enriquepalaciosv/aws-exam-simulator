However, those users might need to work with AWS resources (or work with applications that access those resources).

The identity broker application authenticates the users against the corporate identity store. 3. The identity broker application has permissions to access the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to request temporary security credentials. 4.

Common approaches used include utilizing Sticky sessions or using a Distributed Cache for your session management. In order to address scalability and to provide a shared data storage for sessions that can be accessed from any individual web server, you can abstract the HTTP sessions from the web servers themselves.

Your manager and CTO have approved a complete re-structuring of the websites architecture in order to accommodate future growth. How would you optimize your application in the MOST cost-effective way?","explanation":"Serverless approaches are ideal for applications where load can vary dynamically. Using a serverless approach means no compute costs are incurred when there is no end user traffic, while still offering instant scale to meet high demand, such as a flash sale on an e-commerce site or a social media mention that drives a sudden wave of traffic. Compared to traditional infrastructure approaches, it is also often significantly less expensive to develop, deliver, and operate a web or mobile backend when it has been architected in a serverless fashion. The question allows architectural restructuring and serverless would be the best approach. Moving the application on-premise would not be cost effective as it would change your from variable to operational costs.

This header can be interpreted as the client stating the maximum age a cached result can be is 0 seconds - equivalent to saying it cannot be cached at all.\n\nAs the cache is configured to require authorization to be invalidated, the request must be signed with a user or role that allows the execute-api:InvalidateCache action to be performed on the API Gateway resource. An example of this policy is found in the documentation for API Gateway Caching.
