You have uploaded multiple versions of your code to Lambda, but would like to make sure your test environment always utilizes the latest version. How can you configure this?","explanation":"When you create a Lambda function, there is only one version: $LATEST. You can refer to the function using its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). There are two ARNs associated with this initial version, the qualified ARN which is the function ARN plus a version suffix e.g. $LATEST. Or the unqualified ARN which is the function ARN without the version suffix. The function version for an unqualified function always maps to $LATEST, so you can access the latest version using either the qualified ARN with $LATEST, or the unqualified function ARN.

You want to use a name-value pair system to label and manage your APIs. What feature of API Gateway would you use to accomplish this task?","explanation":"Stage variables are name-value pairs that you can define as configuration attributes associated with a deployment stage of a REST API. They act like environment variables and can be used in your API setup and mapping templates. With deployment stages in API Gateway, you can manage multiple release stages for each API, such as: alpha, beta, and production. Using stage variables you can configure an API deployment stage to interact with different backend endpoints. Environment variables apply to AWS Lambda. Canary release is a software development strategy in which a new version of an API (as well as other software) is deployed as a canary release for testing purposes, and the base version remains deployed as a production release for normal operations on the same stage. (This would be appropriate when your application is live and you'd want to reduce the risk inherent in a new software version release.)

You have a few small number of CloudFormation stacks saved in the Region in which you are operating in. When you launch your stack that contains many EC2 resources, you receive the error Status=start_failed. How would you troubleshoot this issue?","explanation":"Verify that you didn't reach a resource limit. For example, the default number Amazon EC2 instances that you can launch is 20. If you try to create more Amazon EC2 instances than your account limit, the instance creation fails and you receive the error Status=start_failed. Also, during an update, if a resource is replaced, AWS CloudFormation creates new resource before it deletes the old one.

The reads are then forwarded to Lambda downstream for processing critical customer information including purchasing and inventory data. It is critical that this data is not lost.

After a message is taken from the queue and returned for the maximum number of retries, it is automatically sent to a dead letter queue, if one has been configured. It stays there until you retrieve it for forensic purposes. To prevent other consumers from processing the message again, Amazon SQS sets a visibility timeout, a period of time during which Amazon SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing the message. The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. DelaySeconds for individual messages are similar to visibility timeouts because both features make messages unavailable to consumers for a specific period of time. The difference between the two is that, for delay queues, a message is hidden when it is first added to queue, whereas for visibility timeouts a message is hidden only after it is consumed from the queue.

New instances are launching but they periodically fail health checks and subsequent instances are being launched which is increasing costs. What would you do to troubleshoot this issue?","explanation":"Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits until the health check grace period ends before checking the health status of the instance. Amazon EC2 status checks and Elastic Load Balancing health checks can complete before the health check grace period expires. However, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not act on them until the health check grace period expires. To provide ample warm-up time for your instances, ensure that the health check grace period covers the expected startup time for your application. In this scenario, the health checks are most likely occurring before the EC2 instance and its applications have fully loaded, so increasing the health check grace period would likely resolve the issue. The cooldown period helps to ensure that your Auto Scaling group doesn't launch or terminate additional instances before the previous scaling activity takes effect, and are not used for health checks.

This is therefore not part of the correct answer. S3 lifecycle policies are not related to replication of S3 data between accounts or regions. S3 lifecycle policies can be used to transition S3 objects to another Amazon S3 storage class. Using bucket event notifications would also not resolve this issue. Source bucket owner must have permissions to replicate objects on the destination S3 bucket in order for replication to succeed. This is accomplished by providing the source bucket owner permissions in the destination bucket policy. Additionally, source bucket owner must have access permissions to objects in the source bucket that are being replicated in order for replication to succeed. It is possible that IAM users other than the S3 bucket owner have permissions to put objects in the source bucket.

Launching an RDS database as part of an Elastic Beanstalk environment may be suitable for development or PoC environments. However, in general, it isn’t ideal as this means that termination of the Elastic Beanstalk environment will result in termination of the database as well. To protect important data from potential data loss, Amazon RDS database should be launched outside of the Elastic Beanstalk environment. With this approach, we decouple the life-cycle of the database from the life-cycle of the Elastic Beanstalk environment. This method also allows us to connect multiple environments to the same RDS instance. This may be useful for performing advanced deployment scenarios such as blue-green deployments. Storing RDS connection string in an encrypted, secured, and controlled S3 bucket and using Elastic Beanstalk configuration files is a valid method that can be used to securely store this data outside of the application code. Protecting the RDS databases from accidental deletion by enabling Delete Protection is always a good practice.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/AWSHowTo.RDS.html","title":"Using Elastic Beanstalk with Amazon RDS"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/decouple-rds-from-beanstalk/","title":"How do I decouple an Amazon RDS instance from an Elastic Beanstalk environment without downtime, database sync issues, or data loss?"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/rds-external-credentials.html","title":"Storing the connection string in Amazon S3"}],"answers":[{"id":"f8ac7ea397ed3bf0d0dcf3a3d5123521","text":"Amazon RDS databases should be included in the Elastic Beanstalk environment as that maintains the same life cycle for all components of the environment.","correct":true},{"id":"9e19947230060c5fdc4610175989a39e","text":"Amazon RDS Connection String should be stored in a controlled S3 bucket.","correct":false},{"id":"1a265bcccdb4ad642b0a09989c931196","text":"Amazon RDS database should be launched outside of the Elastic Beanstalk environment as that provides more flexibility.","correct":false},{"id":"24e8e8250f45def68ec55670ac2390e7","text":"Amazon RDS Delete Protection should be enabled.","correct":false}]},{"id":"2988d8a0-c66e-434f-948b-acee623892fc","domain":"mon-trb","question":"You work for an electric car company that has its front-end website on EC2.

An Amazon RDS event is created when the reboot is completed. If your DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment, you can force a failover from one Availability Zone (AZ) to another when you reboot. When you force a failover of your DB instance, Amazon RDS automatically switches to a standby replica in another Availability Zone, and updates the DNS record for the DB instance to point to the standby DB instance.
