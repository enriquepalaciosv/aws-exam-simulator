What needs to happen for you to be included in the Organization and receive the discounted pricing?","explanation":"You can invite existing AWS accounts to join your organization. When you start this process, AWS Organizations sends an invitation to the account owner, who then decides whether to accept or decline the invitation. You can use the AWS Organizations console to initiate and manage invitations that you send to other accounts.

The data layer will be hosted on Amazon Aurora in a single AWS Region. Which architecture will provide the highest performing solution for end users?","explanation":"A Route 53 latency routing policy will send requests to the destination with the lowest latency, generally resulting in the best performance. A Route 53 geolocation routing policy will probably not provide better performance than a latency routing policy. Even though targets may be physically closer, they may involve more network hops. Geolocation policies are generally used to serve localized content.

The application uses S3 to store photographs. Your boss has asked you how you can improve the upload and download times for your end users?","explanation":"S3 upload and download times can be improved by enabling Transfer Acceleration. This leverages Points of Presents (PoPs) in the CloudFront network to provide connection points closer to users, thereby improving transfer speeds.  Disabling Object Versioning or enabling Intelligent Tiering would not affect upload or transfer speeds.  Lastly, BitTorrent support is for publicly-available files and is designed to increase availability of files and reduce S3 costs but does not improve upload and download times from the S3 service itself.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html","title":"Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration"}],"answers":[{"id":"792c81205244e2382feec0be4a8a8716","text":"Enable S3 BitTorrent support","correct":false},{"id":"3992a5af710f81ade0226fff00fedf2d","text":"Enable S3 Intelligent Tiering","correct":false},{"id":"5c6679012efaeb73c2123036ba676303","text":"Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration on your buckets","correct":true},{"id":"26b2f3dfb7078bf49a2aafd952d45a13","text":"Disable S3 Object Versioning","correct":false}]},{"id":"9ad79f24-9def-4d1e-9419-2037fdeda2cf","domain":"data-man","question":"In your company, in order to meet compliance requirements, production files in all S3 buckets need to be replicated into S3 buckets in a different region. These files already have a prefix of PROD. Other files without this prefix should not be copied. Which of the following is the fastest and most cost-efficient way to achieve this requirement?","explanation":"Users can easily configure Cross-Region Replication to copy S3 objects to a bucket in another region. In the replication rule, the source can be the entire bucket, a prefix or tags. The solution of using the EC2 instance is not cost-efficient. The Lambda function should only copy files with the PROD prefix.

CodeBuild can run the tests and CodePipeline can manage the pipeline steps for the CI testing and deployment pipeline.
