You want to use a name-value pair system to label and manage your APIs. What feature of API Gateway would you use to accomplish this task?","explanation":"Stage variables are name-value pairs that you can define as configuration attributes associated with a deployment stage of a REST API. They act like environment variables and can be used in your API setup and mapping templates. With deployment stages in API Gateway, you can manage multiple release stages for each API, such as: alpha, beta, and production. Using stage variables you can configure an API deployment stage to interact with different backend endpoints. Environment variables apply to AWS Lambda. Canary release is a software development strategy in which a new version of an API (as well as other software) is deployed as a canary release for testing purposes, and the base version remains deployed as a production release for normal operations on the same stage. (This would be appropriate when your application is live and you'd want to reduce the risk inherent in a new software version release.)

Compared to traditional infrastructure approaches, it is also often significantly less expensive to develop, deliver, and operate a web or mobile backend when it has been architected in a serverless fashion. The question allows architectural restructuring and serverless would be the best approach.

It has already adopted a plan to execute the various phases of the CI/CD pipeline from continuous integration to continuous deployment. There are now discussions around restructuring the team make-up to implement a CI/CD environment. How would you recommend creating developer teams as a best practice to support this change in the long run?","explanation":"AWS recommends organizing three developer teams for implementing a CI/CD environment: an application team, an infrastructure team, and a tools team. This organization represents a set of best practices that have been developed and applied in fast-moving startups, large enterprise organizations, and in Amazon itself. The teams should be no larger than groups that two pizzas can feed, or about 10-12 people. This follows the communication rule that meaningful conversations hit limits as group sizes increase and lines of communication multiply. Hiring an external consulting firm will not be beneficial in the long run. Setting up a single team is not best practice. AWS CodePipeline is a continuous integration and continuous delivery service for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates and not used for team structuring.","links":[{"url":"https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/DevOps/practicing-continuous-integration-continuous-delivery-on-AWS.pdf","title":"Practicing Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery on AWS"}],"answers":[{"id":"d163f1cc494b3cde77122207a42d9de1","text":"Set up one team to own an operate all components of the CI/CD pipeline to consolidate tasks and improve efficiency.","correct":false},{"id":"b943ddf4265197477c4036cdd230b033","text":"Hire an external consulting firm to build and manage the pipeline.

As the application grows in popularity, the required updates are reaching the 256KB message limit of SQS.

However, this would only be a temporary solution. As the number of members increased, the payload size would increase and would start to exceed the SQS message limit again. A more flexible approach is to store the update data in S3. This ensures that the data is stored reliably without any concerns regarding the data size. The SQS message payload would then contain a reference to the S3 blob. If the application is written in Java, the AWS SDK for Java supports this functionality out of the box. SNS has the same message payload limit as SQS, so this is not a suitable option.
