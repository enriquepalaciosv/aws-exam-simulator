Elastic Beanstalk is a service which allows you to run applications without understanding the infrastructure and can be discounted, as can Global Accelerator which is a networking service that improves the availability and performance of applications.

An application requirement is to automatically purge all event data older than 30 days. What is the optimal option to implement this requirement?","explanation":"Time to Live (TTL) for Amazon DynamoDB is functionality that enables automatic deletion of items after a specified expiration time. The expiration time is defined by a timestamp in the TTL attribute. When Time to Live (TTL) is enabled on a table in Amazon DynamoDB, a background job checks the TTL attribute of items. The background job compares the current time in epoch time format to the time stored in the Time to Live attribute of an item to determine whether the item is expired.

You have uploaded multiple versions of your code to Lambda, but would like to make sure your test environment always utilizes the latest version. How can you configure this?","explanation":"When you create a Lambda function, there is only one version: $LATEST. You can refer to the function using its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). There are two ARNs associated with this initial version, the qualified ARN which is the function ARN plus a version suffix e.g. $LATEST. Or the unqualified ARN which is the function ARN without the version suffix. The function version for an unqualified function always maps to $LATEST, so you can access the latest version using either the qualified ARN with $LATEST, or the unqualified function ARN. Lambda also supports creating aliases for each of your Lambda function versions. An alias is a pointer to a specific Lambda function version, aliases will not be updated automatically when a new version of the function becomes available.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/versioning-intro.html","title":"Introduction To Lambda Function Versioning"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/versioning-aliases.html","title":"Lambda Function Versioning and Aliases"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/how-to-manage-versioning.html","title":"Lambda Versioning"}],"answers":[{"id":"d483464867986a2d830ac23858944891","text":"Create an alias to point to the correct version of your code","correct":false},{"id":"07c1095b47175c42406ba59e91205281","text":"Reference the function using an unqualified ARN","correct":true},{"id":"0311fc386b14ce5afd0843ecf4a6ff16","text":"Create another function to automatically update your function alias to point to the latest version of the code every time it is updated","correct":false},{"id":"cc67dedc36d230ab3574dc07b41b7443","text":"Configure the alias to automatically update to point to the latest version of the code every time it is updated","correct":false},{"id":"02f663ae252fea90c711171a5572d211","text":"Reference the function using a qualified ARN and the $LATEST suffix","correct":true}]},{"id":"4102ce86-6e8c-47b2-86d4-86e3b8b08558","domain":"mon-trb","question":"Your application runs in an Auto Scaling group to scale based on user demand. The Auto Scaling group runs behind an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). When you check the ELB logs, you notice that a number of instances are failing the health check during periods of high demand. New instances are launching but they periodically fail health checks and subsequent instances are being launched which is increasing costs. What would you do to troubleshoot this issue?","explanation":"Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits until the health check grace period ends before checking the health status of the instance. Amazon EC2 status checks and Elastic Load Balancing health checks can complete before the health check grace period expires. However, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not act on them until the health check grace period expires. To provide ample warm-up time for your instances, ensure that the health check grace period covers the expected startup time for your application. In this scenario, the health checks are most likely occurring before the EC2 instance and its applications have fully loaded, so increasing the health check grace period would likely resolve the issue. The cooldown period helps to ensure that your Auto Scaling group doesn't launch or terminate additional instances before the previous scaling activity takes effect, and are not used for health checks. Creating a new ELB or Auto Scaling group would have no impact but the problem would persist.

An Amazon RDS event is created when the reboot is completed. If your DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment, you can force a failover from one Availability Zone (AZ) to another when you reboot. When you force a failover of your DB instance, Amazon RDS automatically switches to a standby replica in another Availability Zone, and updates the DNS record for the DB instance to point to the standby DB instance.
