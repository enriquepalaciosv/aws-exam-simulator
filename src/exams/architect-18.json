When an EC2 instance is hibernated, RAM contents are saved to the EBS root volume. RAM contents are reloaded when the instance is restarted. AWS doesn't charge for the time that an instance is in the hibernated state. Storing data in Amazon DynamoDB costs more than EBS. EMR clusters cost more than EC2 instances.

Log analyses indicate that on the heaviest volume days, compute demand comes in triple that of the average volume days. These heavy volume days occur about 15 days per year. You also have some workloads that need to process before close of business to provide input to daily reporting functions. How would you structure your mix of EC2 General Purpose Linux instances to obtain the highest cost efficiency?","explanation":"The most cost effective pricing for EC2 General Purpose Linux instances will usually involve a mix of pricing models. In this scenario, since the number of heavy volume days is limited, using a combination of reserved instances sized for the average volume days, on-demand instances to handle transaction volume increases on the heavy volume days, and spot instances to handle workloads that just need to complete by a certain time is the best option.  Spot instances for reporting workloads will cost less than using reserved instances and capacity doesn't need to be guaranteed. 3-year reserved instances are more cost-effective than one-year-term reserved instances.

Which of the following routing policies should you choose?","explanation":"You need a weighted routing policy because you want to be able to set the proportions traffic routed to your servers. A simple routing policy would have been ideal if you had a single server. Although failover and geolocation routing policies are for routing traffic to more than one resource, the former is ideal for configuring active-passive failover, and the latter is for specifying location rather than traffic proportions.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html","title":"Choosing a Routing Policy"}],"answers":[{"id":"582368ac8232617ead14ac74ccc40ea9","text":"Weighted","correct":true},{"id":"7388404ef116c3ff812bfd290b094d9e","text":"Failover","correct":false},{"id":"1fbb1e3943c2c6c560247ac8f9289780","text":"Simple","correct":false},{"id":"323d4eb70b252acb4a04eaf9e0882597","text":"Geolocation","correct":false}]},{"id":"85006d63-82b7-45dc-88c6-0baddad33725","domain":"ResilientDesign","question":"Which of the following is true with regards to a private IP address of an EC2 instance?","explanation":"Multiple IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6) can be specified for an Instance depending upon Instance Types. Multiple IP addresses can be assigned and unassigned to network interfaces attached to running or stopped instances. An instance receives a static private IPv4 address from the address range within a VPC. Private IP address remains associated with the Network Interface when the instance is stopped and restarted, and is released when the instance is terminated. A secondary private IPv4 address can be assigned to any network interface. The network interface need not be attached to the instance. A secondary private IPv4 address that is assigned to a network interface can be reassigned to another one if you explicitly allow it.

This means that DynamoDB is not a correct option. With RDS Multi-AZ deployment, a primary DB instance is automatically and synchronously replicated to a secondary RDS instance in a different availability zone (AZ). In case of a disaster causing primary instance failure, RDS performs automatic failover to the secondary standby RDS instance. During the failover, the database endpoint remains the same. RDS Read-Replica provide secondary RDS instances that are asynchronous replicated from the primary. RDS read-replicas have different endpoints and do not provide automatic failover. Additionally, they only provide read (not write) operations. It is possible to use Route53 with Health-check and DNS failover configurations to route traffic to multiple RDS instances.

Amazon SES eliminates the complexity and expense of building an in-house email solution or licensing, installing, and operating a third-party email solution.

The client has an elegant solution that works well.  As the information base grows they use CloudFormation to spin up another stack made up of an S3 bucket and supporting compute instances.  The trigger for creating a new stack is when the PUT rate approaches 100 PUTs per second.  the problem is that as the business grows that number of buckets is growing into the hundreds and will soon be in the thousands.  You have been asked what can be done to reduce the number of buckets without changing the basic architecture.","explanation":"Until 2018 there was a hard limit on S3 puts of 100 PUTs per second.  To achieve this care needed to be taken with the structure of the name Key to ensure parallel processing.
