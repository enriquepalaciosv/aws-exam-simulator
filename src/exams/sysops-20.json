CloudFormation conditions control whether certain resources are created or whether certain resource properties are assigned a value during stack creation or update, but don't control the actions of an Auto Scaling Group.

Objects written through file gateway can be directly accessed in S3.  Although Volume and Tape Gateway both push your data to S3 as a back-end, they both provide iSCSI or Virtual Tape devices, and do not provide an NFS or SMB mount point in order to work from S3 as if it was a local file store.
