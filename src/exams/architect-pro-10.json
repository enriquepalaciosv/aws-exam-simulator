The client has stipulated in the contract that the migration cannot require any more than 1 hour downtime at a time and that there is always a fallback path.  Additionally, they want an overall increase in business continuity capabilities when the migration is done.  Their landscape is as follows:  (1) Several databases with about 1TB of data combined which are heavily used 24x7 and considered mission critical; (2) About 40TB of historic files which are read sometimes but almost never updated; (3) About 150 web servers on VMware in various states of customization of which there is a current project underway to standardize them.

You notice that there are several existing roles called role-engineer, role-manager, role-qa, role-dba, role-data-scientist, etc. When a new person joins the company, the new IAM user simply assumes the right role while using AWS - this allows central management of permissions and eliminates the need to manage permissions on a per-user basis.\nA new QA hire joins the company a few days later. You create an IAM User for her. You attach a Policy to the new IAM User that allows Action STS AssumeRole on any Resource. However, when this employee logs in the same day and tries to switch roles to role-qa, she is denied and is unable to assume the role-qa Role.\nWhat could be one reason why this is happening and how can it be best fixed?","explanation":"In order to allow an IAM User to successfully assume an IAM Role, two things must happen. First, the Policy attached to the User must allow the action STS AssumeRole. This is already true according to the question. Second, the Trust Policy of the Role itself must allow the User in question to assume the Role. This second condition can be met if we specify the arn of the User in the Principal element of the Trust Policy. In general, this question can be answered if the candidate is familiar with the concept of Principal in a Role, see link - A Principal within an Amazon IAM Role specifies the user (IAM user, federated user, or assumed-role user), AWS account, AWS service, or other principal entity that is allowed or denied to assume or impersonate that Role. Trust Policy is different than the Policy permissions - think of Policy Permissions as [what can be accessed] and Trust Policy as [who can access].\nTrust Policy cannot belong to an IAM User, hence the choice that claims the problem to be an unmodified User Trust Policy is incorrect. IAM changes are instantly effective, so the choice that points at the need of a time delay is also incorrect.

The applications running in the VPC access, store and process sensitive customer information by reading from and writing to both the S3 buckets. The company is also using a hybrid approach and has several workloads running on-premises. The on-premises datacenter is connected to their AWS VPC using Direct Connect.\nYou have proposed that an S3 VPC Endpoint be created to access the two S3 buckets from the VPC so that sensitive customer data is not exposed to the internet.\nSelect two correct statements from the following that relate to designing this solution using VPC Endpoint.","explanation":"S3 VPC Endpoint is a common topic tested in the SA-P Exam, as it enables S3 access over a private network, which is a common security requirement in many organizations.

That is because if there are 2 or 3 or 4 closely worded choices, only one (or in some rare cases, two) is correct - this is a common pattern in the SA-P test.\nFor the closely worded pair - the bucket policy of an S3 bucket will always specify who can or cannot access the bucket. It will not dictate how a VPC Endpoint behaves. Hence, the choice that suggests that a bucket policy can control a VPC Endpoint is incorrect.\nBetween the other two choices, remember that a VPC Endpoint can connect to any number of S3 buckets by default. One Endpoint for each bucket is simply not scalable, and should stand out as incorrect.\nThe remaining choice is correct because the S3 VPC Endpoint is of type Gateway Endpoint as opposed to Interface Endpoint, and a subnet needs Routes in the Routing Table for sources in the subnet to be able to connect to it.

Most of the site will be static, as it will display metadata about the whitepapers like author, topic, date, excerpts and price. It will not show any link to download the full whitepaper. There will, however, be a payment link for each whitepaper. If users click on the payment link, the Javascript browser-side code will connect directly to a 3rd-party payment processing service which will return success on completion of payment. On success, the Javascript code will make a REST call to your website back-end to fetch a pre-signed S3 URL for that whitepaper and show a new page with the download link.\nThe pre-signed download URL must be a https URL, as you must protect the whitepaper authors from their valuable IP from being pirated using man-in-the-middle attacks while being downloaded. The website itself may be served over HTTP. None of the whitepapers must be publicly accessible without payment, though the website will not deal with any authentication or user profiles.\nIdentify the most suitable solution that will strike a good balance between quickness and convenience, cost and security for building this website.","explanation":"Admittedly verbose and lengthy, this type of question will test the time-management ability along with technical knowledge. It is clearly stated in the question that the website itself does not need to be served over HTTPS, only the pre-signed download URL (which will be used to download the full whitepaper after successful payment) needs to be HTTPS. Therefore, the choice that eliminates S3 static website citing the reason that S3 static websites do not support HTTPS is incorrect. While it is actually correct that S3 static websites do not support HTTPS, the reason for not choosing S3 static websites as a solution cannot be this fact, as the requirement clearly states that the website may be served over HTTP. Only the part that needs HTTPS can be developed outside of S3 static website, as it must be, as S3 static websites are, well, static, and would not be of much help running server-side code to generate pre-signed URLs. Also, the same choice uses EC2 instances and ELB - an approach that is not as quick or convenient as using a S3 static website.\nThe choice that uses Cloudfront and Origin Access Identity (OAI) is incorrect as we cannot use OAI if the origin is an S3 static website endpoint. OAI can only be used if the origin is an S3 bucket (and not a website). Also, using Cloudfront will unnecessarily increase the cost, as the requirement states that the website is regional.\nBoth the remaining choices are actually working solutions. Both will work. However, the best answer is the one that uses S3 static website, as it is the least amount of effort. Using API Gateway with Lambda proxy integration to serve the entire website is more work compared to using an S3 static website. Even when using S3 static website, API Gateway and Lambda needs to be used to generate the pre-signed URLs after the end-user pays for the whitepapers, but that is a small part compared to the full website.","links":[{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-serve-static-website/","title":"Various ways to chain Cloudfront and S3 for hosting websites"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html","title":"Restricting Access to Amazon S3 Content by Using an Origin Access Identity"}],"answers":[{"id":"01d44a44c543778d9db261fe16c999bd","text":"Serve the entire website using API Gateway with proxy Lambda integration.

(The question did not specify we had slow response...just inconsistent response which could be a response faster than we expected.)  When a Lambda function is run for the first time or after an update, AWS must provision the Lambda environment and pull in any external dependencies.

They host their customer database and billing application on IBM mainframes. IBM AIX servers running WebSphere provide an API layer into the mainframes. Customer-facing online applications are hosted on Linux systems. The customer service backend application resides on Oracle Solaris and makes use of gigabytes of persistent information. Their ERP and CRM systems also run on Solaris boxes. Telecom switches send call records to Linux-based applications, and their employee productivity suite runs on Windows. They need to complete the project in twelve months to satisfy budgetary constraints. Which migration strategy will provide them with the most resilient, scalable, and operationally efficient cloud environment within the project time frame?","explanation":"Since the company has twelve months to complete the project, they can plan for a highly cloud-centric migration. Refactoring the mainframe billing application to EC2 and the customer database to Aurora will require significant cost and effort, but will result in significant intermediate to long-term business value for most companies. A number of AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions are available to assist with this. The WebSphere layer can be replaced by API Gateway with HTTP, REST, or WebSocket APIs that call modules on the EC2 instances. Refactoring the customer-facing online apps to Lambda serverless and Step Functions will provide high operational efficiency. Performing a replatform of the Solaris customer service application to EC2 with Auto Scaling will achieve elasticity to avoid the excess capacity inefficiencies that were most-likely present in the on-premises environment. Many robust ERP, CRM, and employee productivity SaaS solutions exist and should be leveraged rather than trying to manage these applications with in-house staff. The call record processing Linux system can simply be rehosted to EC2.

These files are accessed and downloaded by end-users from all US regions and west EU, though the compressed installation packages are downloaded rarely as users tend to access the service from their browsers instead of installing anything on their machines. Each installation package bundles several images and documents, and also includes binaries that are downloaded from a 3rd party service while creating the package files.\nThe images and documents range from a few KBs to a few hundred KBs in size and they are mostly static in nature. However, the compressed installation package files are generated every few hours because of changes done by the 3rd party service to their binaries, and some of them are as large as a few hundred GB-s. The installation package files can be regenerated from the images and documents fairly quickly if required. It is important to be able to retrieve older versions of the images and documents.\nWhich of the following storage solutions is the most cost-effective approach to design the storage for these files?","explanation":"The areas tested by this question are:\\n1. Versioning cannot be enabled at the object level. It is a bucket-level feature. This rules out the choice where we have a single bucket and selectively turn on versioning on for some objects only.\\n2. If you enable Versioning for a bucket containing large objects that are frequently created/uploaded, it will result in higher storage cost as all the previous versions will result in storage volume growing quickly because of frequent writes. In the given scenario, the compressed installation package files are large and also frequently generated (every few hours). There is no requirement to version them, as they can be quickly generated on-demand. Hence, putting them in a bucket that has Versioning enabled is not a good cost-effective solution. This rules out two choices - one where we have a single versioned bucket, the other where we enable versioning for both buckets.\\n3. Note that all options except one correctly identify the storage class requirements - the compressed installation package files should be stored as One-Zone IA because durability is not a prime requirement for these files (simply because they can be regenerated on-demand easily). They are rarely downloaded, hence IA is the correct class. Combined with low durability, One Zone IA is the most cost-effective solution. Only one option uses the incorrect storage tier for these files - note that IA is more expensive than One-Zone IA, and the question is about cost-effectiveness.\nHence, the only correct answer is the one that addresses both Versioning and Storage Class requirements correctly.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectVersioning.html","title":"Documentation on Object Versioning"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html#sc-howtoset","title":"Setting the Storage Class of an Object"}],"answers":[{"id":"2e4e12f367286b12f14ae74b1fd4e350","text":"Store all three kinds of files in a single S3 bucket.

Converting twenty thousand lines of Model-View-Controller code to a serverless architecture in sixty days is unreasonable, so moving the Tomcat MVC as-is to EC2 for the initial migration is the best approach. We can migrate to a serverless user interface in a later phase. Database Migration Service will suit our needs well for moving the application data to Aurora, but the most scalable architecture strategy is to migrate the stored procedure code out of the database so that database nodes won't need to be resized when the business logic needs more compute resources.
