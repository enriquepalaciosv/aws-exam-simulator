What could be the source of this problem?","explanation":"A VPC Network Security Groups are a network security capability providing firewall functionality.  They control inbound and outbound traffic on EC2 or RDS instances. NSG rules applied on the RDS database must be configured to allow inbound traffic from the NSG on the EC2 instances on the database port. If the NSG's on the RDS database are not configured correctly, any connection attempting to access the RDS instance will time out as the database will be unreachable. If database credentials were incorrect, the application would not time out. A connection to the RDS instance would be established, an the database would return an error code.  The question specifically states that there is an issue establishing a connection. VPC peering is used to establish a secure connection between two VPC’s, and is not suitable in this scenario.
