They are then sold to customers on a subscription basis where they receive the monthly collection from the artist(s) they support.

In order for the cluster to work, Node one is started and populated with data before Node two is started. Some weeks later, a new Redis stack is created using the same template, but is populated by a different set of data.  In this case the stack consistantly fails to be created eventhough the template and parameters are identical to the original stack.  Which actions should be taken to ensure that the new cluster can successfully be created?","explanation":"If, as in this case, the order of resources is important, it should never be assumed that they will always stand up in the same order each time, the first stack may have deployed in the correct order by luck.  A 'DependsOn' resource should always be used to maintain order consistancy.  Also, the data that is populating Redis may be much larger and take more time in the second Stack.

Every time a customer completes a purchase, streaming data is immediately sent back to your endpoint and is placed onto a Kinesis Data Stream.  Most of the year, traffic remains static and no scaling of the Stream is necessary.  However, during the Black Friday period, scaling is required and this is accomplished by increasing the KCL instances and also re-sharding the Kinesis Stream.  This year, when sharding some of the streams, it was noticed that an extra shard was left after the operation finished, and this meant that if an even number of shards was requested, the number of open shards became odd.  You have been asked to troubleshoot the issue and find the cause and resolution from the list below.","explanation":"This is an issue which occurs from time to time when re-sharding.  The difference between the StartingHashKey and EndingHashKey values is normally large (depending on the number of shards you have in the stream).  Occasionally, the difference can be a very low value such as 1 and this causes the UpdateShardCount to end up with an extra shard.
