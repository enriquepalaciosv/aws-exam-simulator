However, it also can enable you to rotate secrets for other databases or third-party services.

The changeover completes successfully, but after a few hours you notice that lag starts to appear between the Read/Write Master and the Read Replica.  What actions could you carry out to reduce this lag?","explanation":"One of the most obvious causes of Replication lag between two Aurora databases is because of settings and values, so making the storage size comparable between the source DB and Read Replica is a good start to resolving the issue, as is ensuring compatible DB Parameter settings, such as with the max_allowed_packet parameter.  Turning off the Query Cache is good for tables that are modified often which causes lag, because the cache is locked and refreshed often.

Every time a customer completes a purchase, streaming data is immediately sent back to your endpoint and is placed onto a Kinesis Data Stream.  Most of the year, traffic remains static and no scaling of the Stream is necessary.  However, during the Black Friday period, scaling is required and this is accomplished by increasing the KCL instances and also re-sharding the Kinesis Stream.  This year, when sharding some of the streams, it was noticed that an extra shard was left after the operation finished, and this meant that if an even number of shards was requested, the number of open shards became odd.  You have been asked to troubleshoot the issue and find the cause and resolution from the list below.","explanation":"This is an issue which occurs from time to time when re-sharding.  The difference between the StartingHashKey and EndingHashKey values is normally large (depending on the number of shards you have in the stream).
