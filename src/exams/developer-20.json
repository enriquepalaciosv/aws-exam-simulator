The requirements are to maintain full capacity, deploy five instances at once for the new version, and to terminate instances running the old version once the new instances are running successfully. How would you implement this deployment policy?","explanation":"To maintain full capacity during deployments, you can configure your environment to launch a new batch of instances before taking any instances out of service. This option is known as a rolling deployment with an additional batch. When the deployment completes, Elastic Beanstalk terminates the additional batch of instances. All at Once deployment takes the instances in your environment out of service for a short time.

Launching an RDS database as part of an Elastic Beanstalk environment may be suitable for development or PoC environments. However, in general, it isn’t ideal as this means that termination of the Elastic Beanstalk environment will result in termination of the database as well. To protect important data from potential data loss, Amazon RDS database should be launched outside of the Elastic Beanstalk environment. With this approach, we decouple the life-cycle of the database from the life-cycle of the Elastic Beanstalk environment. This method also allows us to connect multiple environments to the same RDS instance. This may be useful for performing advanced deployment scenarios such as blue-green deployments. Storing RDS connection string in an encrypted, secured, and controlled S3 bucket and using Elastic Beanstalk configuration files is a valid method that can be used to securely store this data outside of the application code. Protecting the RDS databases from accidental deletion by enabling Delete Protection is always a good practice.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/AWSHowTo.RDS.html","title":"Using Elastic Beanstalk with Amazon RDS"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/decouple-rds-from-beanstalk/","title":"How do I decouple an Amazon RDS instance from an Elastic Beanstalk environment without downtime, database sync issues, or data loss?"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/rds-external-credentials.html","title":"Storing the connection string in Amazon S3"}],"answers":[{"id":"9e19947230060c5fdc4610175989a39e","text":"Amazon RDS Connection String should be stored in a controlled S3 bucket.","correct":false},{"id":"24e8e8250f45def68ec55670ac2390e7","text":"Amazon RDS Delete Protection should be enabled.","correct":false},{"id":"1a265bcccdb4ad642b0a09989c931196","text":"Amazon RDS database should be launched outside of the Elastic Beanstalk environment as that provides more flexibility.","correct":false},{"id":"f8ac7ea397ed3bf0d0dcf3a3d5123521","text":"Amazon RDS databases should be included in the Elastic Beanstalk environment as that maintains the same life cycle for all components of the environment.","correct":true}]},{"id":"098e4897-54dd-493d-ae35-d28374c03576","domain":"security","question":"You application can be accessed using multiple devices, for example, laptop, tablet, iPhone or Android devices.

An EC2 instance consumes the data from the stream using the Kinesis Client Library. You have recently increased the number of shards in your stream to 6 and your project manager is now suggesting that you need to add at least 6 additional EC2 instances to cope with the new shards. What do you recommend?","explanation":"Re-sharding enables you to increase or decrease the number of shards in a stream in order to adapt to changes in the rate of data flowing through the stream. You should ensure that the number of instances does not exceed the number of shards (except for failure standby purposes). Each shard is processed by exactly one KCL worker and has exactly one corresponding record processor, so you never need multiple instances to process one shard. However, one worker can process any number of shards, so it's fine if the number of shards exceeds the number of instances. When re-sharding increases the number of shards in the stream, the corresponding increase in the number of record processors increases the load on the EC2 instances that are hosting them. If the instances are part of an Auto Scaling group, and the load increases sufficiently, the Auto Scaling group adds more instances to handle the increased load.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/key-concepts.html","title":"Kinesis Data Streams Terminology"},{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/kinesis-record-processor-scaling.html","title":"Resharding, Scaling, and Parallel Processing"}],"answers":[{"id":"7561e4f93183899bc8757da9db13ae60","text":"One worker can process any number of shards, so it's fine if the number of shards exceeds the number of instances","correct":true},{"id":"c11271a6921d20363c624ddde1790781","text":"You should decrease the number of shards to match the number of consumer instances","correct":false},{"id":"6c565b117fa64cb3b8ddaf38c670efed","text":"You should increase the number of instances to match the number of shards","correct":false},{"id":"1c8f531c39885147b4935b0e64880b97","text":"The number of instances should be greater than number of shards","correct":false}]},{"id":"007a648d-faa9-4464-9816-0b646386047f","domain":"mon-trb","question":"A three-tier application consists of a presentation and application tier deployed on EC2 instances in a public VPC subnet, and a data tier hosted on an RDS databases in a private VPC subnet.  When attempting to establish a connection to the RDS database, the application times out.  What could be the source of this problem?","explanation":"A VPC Network Security Groups are a network security capability providing firewall functionality.  They control inbound and outbound traffic on EC2 or RDS instances. NSG rules applied on the RDS database must be configured to allow inbound traffic from the NSG on the EC2 instances on the database port. If the NSG's on the RDS database are not configured correctly, any connection attempting to access the RDS instance will time out as the database will be unreachable. If database credentials were incorrect, the application would not time out. A connection to the RDS instance would be established, an the database would return an error code.

Your company has been trending this quarter because a high profile movie star has recently signed a contract to endorse your products. As a result, the amount of data flowing through Kinesis has increased, causing you to increase the number of shards in your stream from 4 to 6. The application consuming the data runs on a single EC2 instance in us-east-1a with a second instance in us-east-1b which is used as a cold standby in case the primary instance fails. How many consumer instances will you now need in total to cope with the increased number of shards?","explanation":"Re-sharding enables you to increase or decrease the number of shards in a stream in order to adapt to changes in the rate of data flowing through the stream. You should ensure that the number of instances does not exceed the number of shards (except for failure standby purposes). Each shard is processed by exactly one KCL worker and has exactly one corresponding record processor, so you never need multiple instances to process one shard. However, one worker can process any number of shards, so it's fine if the number of shards exceeds the number of instances. When re-sharding increases the number of shards in the stream, the corresponding increase in the number of record processors increases the load on the EC2 instances that are hosting them.

Then, you just use the resource to reference that template from within other templates. Lambda would not be able to deploy infrastructure resources as efficiently as CloudFormation nested stacks.

Using a random prefix for the GSI partition key and County of Origin as the sort key enables us to have high cardinality for the partition key (thus avoiding any hot partitions) while still allowing for fast querying based on the Country of Origin. Publication Date is a poor choice for the partition key as it is a low cardinality attribute. It results in a hot partition for all items published on that date.

Amazon EC2 status checks and Elastic Load Balancing health checks can complete before the health check grace period expires. However, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not act on them until the health check grace period expires. To provide ample warm-up time for your instances, ensure that the health check grace period covers the expected startup time for your application. In this scenario, the health checks are most likely occurring before the EC2 instance and its applications have fully loaded, so increasing the health check grace period would likely resolve the issue. The cooldown period helps to ensure that your Auto Scaling group doesn't launch or terminate additional instances before the previous scaling activity takes effect, and are not used for health checks.
