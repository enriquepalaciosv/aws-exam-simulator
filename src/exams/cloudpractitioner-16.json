Therefore, if you deploy your application in 2 instances in 2 AZs, and one of the AZs fails, you will still have 1 instance running your application. Automation relates simplifying common repeated tasks and removing the human element.

When it comes to S3, this includes all aspects of capacity management, therefore it is an AWS responsibility to make sure that they never run out of storage. Replication to another AZ is also AWS's responsibility in an applicable storage tier - note that the question asks for AZ replication - not Regional Replication which would normally be the customer's responsibility to configure. AWS is also responsible for managing data corruption and resolving it if corruption is detected - however if it cannot fix the corruption, or if data is lost, AWS bears no responsibility for the loss - therefore it is a customer's responsibility to make sure there data is backup up as needed - either though versioning in S3, or through 3rd party tools.","links":[{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/","title":"The AWS Shared Responsibility Model"},{"url":"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/?nc=sn&loc=7","title":"S3 FAQ - Durability and Data Protection"}],"answers":[{"id":"f5a4db96c8f945bbaddfca968bc66a00","text":"Replicating your data to another Availability Zone if redundancy is needed","correct":false},{"id":"18e8e0efaea5ce9a47da52086c745de7","text":"Making sure there is enough physical storage available for your data","correct":false},{"id":"caec507833650a0d1b82cc852d15ea1f","text":"Backing up your data","correct":true},{"id":"96b64de5e30defc9bab2e6592e515b17","text":"Making sure that enough space has been provisioned for your data","correct":false},{"id":"f3cc93bd6eec33bc0d666a86175524cd","text":"Making sure your data is not corrupted","correct":false}]},{"id":"pzjuwu91-24rb-x77o-tzlj-dzpn3pvo3v3v","domain":"security","question":"You need to use an AWS service to assess the security and compliance of your EC2 instances.
