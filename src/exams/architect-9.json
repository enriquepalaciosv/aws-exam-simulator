You are an AWS consultant and the company approaches you to provide recommendations on how to reduce operational cost without any major changes. The company confirms that certain instances are required to be run only during business hours from 8AM to 6PM on weekdays and can be shutdown on weekends and non-business hours. Which of the following automated solutions best matches the requirements?","explanation":"AWS offers infrastructure on demand so that customers can control their resource capacity and pay only for what they consume. One simple method to reduce costs is to stop resources that are not in use, and then start those resources again when their capacity is needed. The AWS Instance Scheduler is a simple AWS-provided solution that enables customers to easily configure custom start and stop schedules for their Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS instances. The solution is easy to deploy and can help reduce operational costs for both development and production environments. Customers who use this solution to run instances during regular business hours can save up to 70% compared to running those instances 24 hours a day. AWS Auto Scaling is not a correct solution as auto-scaling groups can contain Amazon EC2 instances from multiple Availability Zones within the same Region and cannot contain instances from multiple regions. As the company confirms that the instances are required to be run during Business hours, Spot Instance is not a good choice as spot instances may be terminated if the spot price is higher than the bid price. Also, moving AWS Instances to lesser configurations is neither an automated solution nor guarantees saving operational cost if run 24 hours.","links":[{"url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/instance-scheduler/overview.html","title":"AWS Instance Scheduler"}],"answers":[{"id":"f4bf61a51bd424cab4d9129fd4f2ef6a","text":"Move Instances to Spot Instances","correct":false},{"id":"c9eccc5399c22049703ce9be447d23d7","text":"AWS Instance Scheduler","correct":true},{"id":"2f766b7c3ac605171e839f447d7e239c","text":"AWS Auto Scaling","correct":false},{"id":"f657bd5509ffc79a6cb033747ff52f50","text":"Move AWS instances to lesser configuration Instance Type","correct":false}]},{"id":"1b16d00d-84a4-4eb9-ae8a-ab80164b5ecb","domain":"Performant","question":"You have suggested moving your company's web servers to AWS, but your supervisor is concerned about cost.

In addition, the company wants the records to be accessible from the archive within 12 hours. Which of the following storage services will fulfill this company’s requirements?","explanation":"Although Response B would have been the correct answer, this question demands the answer to be more specific. S3 Glacier is the S3 storage class that you need to archive the records. Storage Gateway is for connecting an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to the company’s AWS storage infrastructure, which can include S3.

Upon investigation, you find that the application's Amazon RDS MySQL database has become memory constrained due to increased transaction volumes. Most of the application's recent activity involves writing new lead records and updating existing lead records. How will you best scale the database to satisfy the increase in business opportunities?","explanation":"You can scale the compute resources for an RDS database by migrating to a larger DB Instance class through the Management Console, the RDS API, or the AWS CLI. RDS currently doesn't support horizontal DB Instance scaling, but Amazon Aurora offers multi-master capabilities. Read Replicas will probably not solve the slow response time issue since most of the application transactions involve write activity.

The applications must be able to exchange data with each other, and they need to be able to communicate with two company-owned data centers. Which architecture will accomplish these requirements in the most secure and operationally efficient way?","explanation":"Direct Connect offers greater security than a VPN because it doesn’t involve an Internet connection.
