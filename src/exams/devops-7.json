The Operations Team have been asked to design a solution so that whenever a message appears in the DynamoDB table, it informs another process that this has happened.  As this process only polls an SQS queue, they have decided to transfer the DynamoDB files to SQS using an AWS Step Function.

Choose which of the following are recognised Step Functions Best Practices.","explanation":"All answers are Step Functions Best Practices, apart from \"Ignoring Lambda Service Exceptions\" and \"Avoiding Defining Timeouts in State Machine Definitions\".  To avoid latency, separate polling threads and open at least 100 polls per activity ARN.  Step functions have a hard 25,000 execution limit so ongoing work should be split across multiple workflow executions to prevent this.

Your Manager has said that RDS is now showing a RDS-EVENT-0045 error after one of the team made a configuration change, then left to go on holiday.  After restarting the replication, you briefly get an RDS-EVENT-0046 notification which quickly returns another RDS-EVENT-0045 notification and replication stops again.

It can't be a database engine issue, because replication will only run on a transactional engine like InnoDB.  Deleting and recreating the read replicas can resolve an issue, but only if there are data inconsistencies and performing only that operation, means that those errors will come back.

With this constraint dealt with, we can eliminate all options that don't include the ECS Cluster.  Putting all containers on one ECS Cluster would work technically, but wouldn't be cost effective and would mean an internal departmental application lives on the same cluster as the main core production applications.

The changeover completes successfully, but after a few hours you notice that lag starts to appear between the Read/Write Master and the Read Replica.  What actions could you carry out to reduce this lag?","explanation":"One of the most obvious causes of Replication lag between two Aurora databases is because of settings and values, so making the storage size comparable between the source DB and Read Replica is a good start to resolving the issue, as is ensuring compatible DB Parameter settings, such as with the max_allowed_packet parameter.

Each new product event requires that iterative code changes be made during pre-launch preparation based on marketing department feedback and testing results. Slow response times for users have occurred during previous launches, so leadership has directed that load tests be conducted on the e-commerce platform after each new code release. Load testing requires significant time to manually setup and execute, which slows down the development process. You've been tasked with creating an automated load testing service on AWS to shorten testing windows. Which architecture will you recommend to provide scalable load testing capabilities?","explanation":"Simulating thousands of connected users generating a select number of transactions per second can be done without having to provision servers. A test automation framework Docker image deployed on AWS Fargate can be scaled according to user-specified test scenarios. The test scenarios can be created in a web application, and written to S3 and DynamoDB by a Lambda function front-ended by API Gateway. These test scenarios can then be read by another Lambda function to manage Fargate's container scaling to generate the desired load on the e-commerce application. Hosting the web application on Elastic Beanstalk is overkill since test scenarios will probably be entered by a single user for only a short duration of time. S3 configured for static web hosting is a more economical option. Auto Scaling EC2 instances won't generate load according to the specified test scenarios - there's no way to get those scenarios into scaling policies. Running the test automation framework in a Lambda function will risk exceeding Lambda's maximum execution time.
